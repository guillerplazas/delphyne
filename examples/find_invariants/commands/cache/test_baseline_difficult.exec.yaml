            Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

            We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear** arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT** propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y * (y + 1)`.

            I will show you a Why3 program with a single loop and a final assertion. The goal is to prove this assertion by providing a sequence of loop invariants. As a reminder, an invariant is a formula that holds initially and that is preserved by the loop body (it is true at the end of an iteration if it is true at the start). Your job is to find a list of invariants that together imply the final assertion.

            Please reason carefully and then finish your answer with a YAML object surrounded by triple quotes that denotes a list of invariants. If you make a mistake (your suggested invariants do not imply the postcondition, an invariant does not hold initially or could not be proved to be preserved), I will show you the failing proof obligations and you'll have a chance to answer again. If there

            ## Why3 Feedback

            If there is a syntax error in your answer, I'll give you Why3's error message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be proved, we'll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:

            - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants
            - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially
            - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may be needed to complete the proof)

            In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).

            ## Advice

            Here is some advice for finding invariants:

            - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body, it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.
            - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for `c` a constant.
            - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.
            - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).

              Why is `x <> y` always true at the end of the program? It is true initially since `y = 3` and `x < 0`. What happens in the loop body then? `x` is incremented and `y` is incremented if and only if the conditional guard `z < 0` evaluates to true. When does this happen? `z` is 0 initially and is only decremented afterwards. Thus, `z <= 0` is an invariant and the conditional statement always executes (since it does if and only if `z - 1 < 0` at the start of the loop iteration). Thus, `x` and `y` are always incremented by 1 at each iteration and so `x <> y` is preserved.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "x <> y"
              - "z <= 0"

              Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.

              We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.

              We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "3*x - 2*y >= 6"

              The final assertion is guarded by assumption `n > 0`. However, `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global assumption for now.

              Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption) and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g >= 1` true.

              However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally. But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant instead.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)"

          Let's analyze the program:

          - Initially, `sn = 0` and `i = 1`.
          - The loop continues as long as `i <= n`.
          - At each iteration:
            - `i` is incremented by 1.
            - `sn` is incremented by 1.

          We want to prove that if at the end `sn <> n` then `sn = 0`.

          Since `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 until it becomes `n+1`, the loop runs `(n - 1 + 1) = n` times if `n >= 1`.

          Thus after the loop:

          - `i = n + 1`
          - `sn = n` if the loop ran normally.

          But if `n < 1`, the loop doesn't run, and `sn` remains `0`.

          So, the invariant should capture the relation between `i` and `sn`:

          - Since `sn` counts the number of iterations, and `i` starts at 1 and is incremented by 1 each iteration,  `sn = i - 1` should hold.

          Also, since the loop stops when `i` becomes `n + 1` or greater, we have `i >= 1` always and `i <= n + 1` during the loop.

          So, the candidate invariants are:

          - `sn = i - 1`
          - `1 <= i <= n + 1`

          Let me represent that as invariant formulas.

          Answer:
          ```
          - "sn = i - 1"
          - "1 <= i"
          - "i <= n + 1"

            Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

            We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear** arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT** propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y * (y + 1)`.

            I will show you a Why3 program with a single loop and a final assertion. The goal is to prove this assertion by providing a sequence of loop invariants. As a reminder, an invariant is a formula that holds initially and that is preserved by the loop body (it is true at the end of an iteration if it is true at the start). Your job is to find a list of invariants that together imply the final assertion.

            Please reason carefully and then finish your answer with a YAML object surrounded by triple quotes that denotes a list of invariants. If you make a mistake (your suggested invariants do not imply the postcondition, an invariant does not hold initially or could not be proved to be preserved), I will show you the failing proof obligations and you'll have a chance to answer again. If there

            ## Why3 Feedback

            If there is a syntax error in your answer, I'll give you Why3's error message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be proved, we'll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:

            - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants
            - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially
            - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may be needed to complete the proof)

            In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).

            ## Advice

            Here is some advice for finding invariants:

            - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body, it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.
            - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for `c` a constant.
            - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.
            - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).

              Why is `x <> y` always true at the end of the program? It is true initially since `y = 3` and `x < 0`. What happens in the loop body then? `x` is incremented and `y` is incremented if and only if the conditional guard `z < 0` evaluates to true. When does this happen? `z` is 0 initially and is only decremented afterwards. Thus, `z <= 0` is an invariant and the conditional statement always executes (since it does if and only if `z - 1 < 0` at the start of the loop iteration). Thus, `x` and `y` are always incremented by 1 at each iteration and so `x <> y` is preserved.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "x <> y"

              Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.

              We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.

              We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

              The final assertion is guarded by assumption `n > 0`. However, `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global assumption for now.

              Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption) and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g >= 1` true.

              However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally. But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant instead.

              Answer:
              ```

              Let's analyze the program:

              - Initially, `sn = 0` and `i = 1`.
              - The loop continues as long as `i <= n`.
              - At each iteration:
                - `i` is incremented by 1.
                - `sn` is incremented by 1.

              We want to prove that if at the end `sn <> n` then `sn = 0`.

              Since `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 until it becomes `n+1`, the loop runs `(n - 1 + 1) = n` times if `n >= 1`.

              Thus after the loop:

              - `i = n + 1`
              - `sn = n` if the loop ran normally.

              But if `n < 1`, the loop doesn't run, and `sn` remains `0`.

              So, the invariant should capture the relation between `i` and `sn`:

              - Since `sn` counts the number of iterations, and `i` starts at 1 and is incremented by 1 each iteration,  `sn = i - 1` should hold.

              Also, since the loop stops when `i` becomes `n + 1` or greater, we have `i >= 1` always and `i <= n + 1` during the loop.

              So, the candidate invariants are:

              - `sn = i - 1`
              - `1 <= i <= n + 1`

              Let me represent that as invariant formulas.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "sn = i - 1"
              - "1 <= i"
              - "i <= n + 1"

          Initially, there is no assumption about the relation between `i` and `n`. Since `i = 1` initially and `n` is arbitrary (could be any integer), `i <= n + 1` means `1 <= n + 1`, which is `n >= 0`. But no such assumption exists, so `i <= n + 1` may not hold initially.

          Hence, invariant `i <= n + 1` is too strong.

          We can fix this by relaxing `i <= n + 1` to:

          `i <= n + 1 || i <= 1` which is logically weaker and holds initially since `i = 1`.

          But this is a disjunction; instead, following the advice, an invariant of the form:

          `i <= n + 1 || i <= 1`

          is acceptable only if we allow disjunction.

          Alternatively, since `i` starts at 1 and is increased by 1 each time, and the loop guard is `i <= n`, maybe a simpler invariant is:

          `i <= n + 1 || n < 0`

          Because if `n < 0`, the loop never starts (since `i=1`), else `i <= n + 1`.

          However, for proof obligations, using `i <= n + 1 || n < 0` is lengthy. Instead, I propose to keep `1 <= i` (which is easy), and for the upper bound:

          `i <= n + 1 || n < 0`

          But easier is to remove the `i <= n + 1` invariant and keep:

          - `sn = i - 1`
          - `1 <= i`

          Since the loop guard is `i <= n`, the variable `i` will be incremented until `i = n + 1`, so `i <= n + 1` will hold after loop body. But for the invariant, since `n` arbitrary, we can skip this bound.

          From the postcondition, if `sn <> n` then `sn = 0`. This holds because:

          - If `n < 1`, the loop doesn't execute so `sn = 0`.

          - If `n >= 1`, the loop runs exactly `n` times, so `sn = n`.

          So the invariant `sn = i - 1` together with `1 <= i` is sufficient.

          I'll propose the following invariants:

          - `sn = i - 1`

          - `1 <= i`

          Answer:
          ```
          - "sn = i - 1"
          - "1 <= i"
          ```

            Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

            We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear** arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT** propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y * (y + 1)`.

            I will show you a Why3 program with a single loop and a final assertion. The goal is to prove this assertion by providing a sequence of loop invariants. As a reminder, an invariant is a formula that holds initially and that is preserved by the loop body (it is true at the end of an iteration if it is true at the start). Your job is to find a list of invariants that together imply the final assertion.

            Please reason carefully and then finish your answer with a YAML object surrounded by triple quotes that denotes a list of invariants. If you make a mistake (your suggested invariants do not imply the postcondition, an invariant does not hold initially or could not be proved to be preserved), I will show you the failing proof obligations and you'll have a chance to answer again. If there

            ## Why3 Feedback

            If there is a syntax error in your answer, I'll give you Why3's error message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be proved, we'll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:

            - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants
            - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially
            - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may be needed to complete the proof)

            In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).

            ## Advice

            Here is some advice for finding invariants:

            - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body, it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.
            - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for `c` a constant.
            - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.
            - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).

              Why is `x <> y` always true at the end of the program? It is true initially since `y = 3` and `x < 0`. What happens in the loop body then? `x` is incremented and `y` is incremented if and only if the conditional guard `z < 0` evaluates to true. When does this happen? `z` is 0 initially and is only decremented afterwards. Thus, `z <= 0` is an invariant and the conditional statement always executes (since it does if and only if `z - 1 < 0` at the start of the loop iteration). Thus, `x` and `y` are always incremented by 1 at each iteration and so `x <> y` is preserved.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "x <> y"
              - "z <= 0"

              Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.

              We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.

              We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "3*x - 2*y >= 6"
              - "x < 12"
              ```

              The final assertion is guarded by assumption `n > 0`. However, `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global assumption for now.

              Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption) and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g >= 1` true.

              However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally. But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant instead.

              ```

              Let's analyze the program:

              - Initially, `sn = 0` and `i = 1`.
              - The loop continues as long as `i <= n`.
              - At each iteration:
                - `i` is incremented by 1.
                - `sn` is incremented by 1.

              We want to prove that if at the end `sn <> n` then `sn = 0`.

              Since `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 until it becomes `n+1`, the loop runs `(n - 1 + 1) = n` times if `n >= 1`.

              Thus after the loop:

              - `i = n + 1`
              - `sn = n` if the loop ran normally.

              But if `n < 1`, the loop doesn't run, and `sn` remains `0`.

              So, the invariant should capture the relation between `i` and `sn`:

              - Since `sn` counts the number of iterations, and `i` starts at 1 and is incremented by 1 each iteration,  `sn = i - 1` should hold.

              Also, since the loop stops when `i` becomes `n + 1` or greater, we have `i >= 1` always and `i <= n + 1` during the loop.

              So, the candidate invariants are:

              - `sn = i - 1`
              - `1 <= i <= n + 1`

              Let me represent that as invariant formulas.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "sn = i - 1"
              - "1 <= i"
              - "i <= n + 1"

              The failed obligation is about proving that the invariant `i <= n + 1` holds initially, right after `i <- 1` and `n` arbitrary.

              Initially, there is no assumption about the relation between `i` and `n`. Since `i = 1` initially and `n` is arbitrary (could be any integer), `i <= n + 1` means `1 <= n + 1`, which is `n >= 0`. But no such assumption exists, so `i <= n + 1` may not hold initially.

              Hence, invariant `i <= n + 1` is too strong.

              We can fix this by relaxing `i <= n + 1` to:

              `i <= n + 1 || i <= 1` which is logically weaker and holds initially since `i = 1`.

              But this is a disjunction; instead, following the advice, an invariant of the form:

              `i <= n + 1 || i <= 1`

              is acceptable only if we allow disjunction.

              Alternatively, since `i` starts at 1 and is increased by 1 each time, and the loop guard is `i <= n`, maybe a simpler invariant is:

              `i <= n + 1 || n < 0`

              Because if `n < 0`, the loop never starts (since `i=1`), else `i <= n + 1`.

              However, for proof obligations, using `i <= n + 1 || n < 0` is lengthy. Instead, I propose to keep `1 <= i` (which is easy), and for the upper bound:

              `i <= n + 1 || n < 0`

              But easier is to remove the `i <= n + 1` invariant and keep:

              - `sn = i - 1`
              - `1 <= i`

              Since the loop guard is `i <= n`, the variable `i` will be incremented until `i = n + 1`, so `i <= n + 1` will hold after loop body. But for the invariant, since `n` arbitrary, we can skip this bound.

              From the postcondition, if `sn <> n` then `sn = 0`. This holds because:

              - If `n < 1`, the loop doesn't execute so `sn = 0`.

              - If `n >= 1`, the loop runs exactly `n` times, so `sn = n`.

              So the invariant `sn = i - 1` together with `1 <= i` is sufficient.

              I'll propose the following invariants:

              - `sn = i - 1`

              - `1 <= i`

              Answer:
              ```
              - "sn = i - 1"
              - "1 <= i"

          Let's analyze why this assertion `if sn <> n then assert { sn = 0 }` fails the proof.

          From the invariants we have:

          - `sn = i - 1`
          - `1 <= i`

          When the loop ends, the guard `i <= n` is false, so `i > n`.

          Therefore, when the loop is done:

          - `i >= n + 1` (since integers)
          - `sn = i - 1 >= n`

          Now, consider the value of `sn` and `n`:

          - If `n < 1`, the loop is never entered (`i = 1`, `i <= n` is false), so `sn = 0` (initialized) and `sn <> n` could be true (if `n < 0` or `n = 0`), and `sn = 0` holds, so assertion is true.

          - If `n >= 1`, the loop executes, increasing `i` until `i = n + 1`, and `sn = i - 1 = n`.

          Therefore, at loop end, we have `sn = n`.

          So `sn <> n` is false, thus the condition of the if statement is false and the assertion is vacuously true.

          Hence, the assertion is true.

          Why then does Why3 fail to prove it?

          Because our invariant does not guarantee `i <= n + 1`. With only `1 <= i` and `sn = i - 1`, the following could happen:

          - For a negative n (say, `n = -5`), we have `i = 1 > n = -5`, so loop not entered, `sn = 0`. So, `if sn <> n` is `if 0 <> -5` true, and assertion expects `sn = 0`, which holds.

          - For `n >= 1`, `i` grows up to `n+1`, so `sn = n` and `sn <> n` is false.

          But because we don't have an upper bound on `i`, we might not be able to conclude formally.

          So we need to express the inequality `i <= n + 1` but only when the loop can run.

          The problem addressed in the earlier feedback was to prove the invariant `i <= n + 1` initially.

          Our analysis in the first feedback was that `i <= n + 1` initially does not hold if `n` is negative since `1 <= n + 1` means `n >= 0`.

          But wait, the loop guard is `i <= n`; if `n < 1`, the loop is not entered and `sn = 0`.

          Therefore, we can modify the invariant `i <= n + 1` and make it conditional:

          `i <= n + 1 || n < 1`

          This disjunction holds initially because if `n < 1`, then this is true, else `i = 1 <= n + 1` if `n >= 1`.

          This also helps with the loop.

          Thus, let's propose the invariants:

          - `sn = i - 1`

          - `1 <= i`

          - `i <= n + 1 || n < 1`

          This last invariant is a disjunction but allowed as it is a logical combination of linear inequalities.

          Answer:
          ```
          - "sn = i - 1"
          - "1 <= i"
          - "i <= n + 1 || n < 1"

            Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

            We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear** arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT** propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y * (y + 1)`.

            I will show you a Why3 program with a single loop and a final assertion. The goal is to prove this assertion by providing a sequence of loop invariants. As a reminder, an invariant is a formula that holds initially and that is preserved by the loop body (it is true at the end of an iteration if it is true at the start). Your job is to find a list of invariants that together imply the final assertion.

            Please reason carefully and then finish your answer with a YAML object surrounded by triple quotes that denotes a list of invariants. If you make a mistake (your suggested invariants do not imply the postcondition, an invariant does not hold initially or could not be proved to be preserved), I will show you the failing proof obligations and you'll have a chance to answer again. If there

            ## Why3 Feedback

            If there is a syntax error in your answer, I'll give you Why3's error message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be proved, we'll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:

            - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants
            - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially
            - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may be needed to complete the proof)

            In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).

            ## Advice

            Here is some advice for finding invariants:

            - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.
            - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body, it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.
            - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for `c` a constant.
            - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as an invariant instead.
            - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.
            - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).

              Why is `x <> y` always true at the end of the program? It is true initially since `y = 3` and `x < 0`. What happens in the loop body then? `x` is incremented and `y` is incremented if and only if the conditional guard `z < 0` evaluates to true. When does this happen? `z` is 0 initially and is only decremented afterwards. Thus, `z <= 0` is an invariant and the conditional statement always executes (since it does if and only if `z - 1 < 0` at the start of the loop iteration). Thus, `x` and `y` are always incremented by 1 at each iteration and so `x <> y` is preserved.

              Answer:
              ```
              - "x <> y"
              - "z <= 0"

              Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.

              We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.

              We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

              The final assertion is guarded by assumption `n > 0`. However, `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global assumption for now.

              Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption) and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g >= 1` true.

              However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally. But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant instead.

              Answer:
              ```

              Let's analyze the program:

              - Initially, `sn = 0` and `i = 1`.
              - The loop continues as long as `i <= n`.
              - At each iteration:
                - `i` is incremented by 1.
                - `sn` is incremented by 1.

              We want to prove that if at the end `sn <> n` then `sn = 0`.

              Since `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 until it becomes `n+1`, the loop runs `(n - 1 + 1) = n` times if `n >= 1`.

              Thus after the loop:

              - `i = n + 1`
              - `sn = n` if the loop ran normally.

              But if `n < 1`, the loop doesn't run, and `sn` remains `0`.

              So, the invariant should capture the relation between `i` and `sn`:

              - Since `sn` counts the number of iterations, and `i` starts at 1 and is incremented by 1 each iteration,  `sn = i - 1` should hold.

              Also, since the loop stops when `i` becomes `n + 1` or greater, we have `i >= 1` always and `i <= n + 1` during the loop.

              So, the candidate invariants are:

              - `sn = i - 1`
              - `1 <= i <= n + 1`

              Let me represent that as invariant formulas.

              - "1 <= i"

              The failed obligation is about proving that the invariant `i <= n + 1` holds initially, right after `i <- 1` and `n` arbitrary.

              Initially, there is no assumption about the relation between `i` and `n`. Since `i = 1` initially and `n` is arbitrary (could be any integer), `i <= n + 1` means `1 <= n + 1`, which is `n >= 0`. But no such assumption exists, so `i <= n + 1` may not hold initially.

              Hence, invariant `i <= n + 1` is too strong.

              We can fix this by relaxing `i <= n + 1` to:

              `i <= n + 1 || i <= 1` which is logically weaker and holds initially since `i = 1`.

              But this is a disjunction; instead, following the advice, an invariant of the form:

              `i <= n + 1 || i <= 1`

              is acceptable only if we allow disjunction.

              Alternatively, since `i` starts at 1 and is increased by 1 each time, and the loop guard is `i <= n`, maybe a simpler invariant is:

              `i <= n + 1 || n < 0`

              Because if `n < 0`, the loop never starts (since `i=1`), else `i <= n + 1`.

              However, for proof obligations, using `i <= n + 1 || n < 0` is lengthy. Instead, I propose to keep `1 <= i` (which is easy), and for the upper bound:

              `i <= n + 1 || n < 0`

              But easier is to remove the `i <= n + 1` invariant and keep:

              - `sn = i - 1`
              - `1 <= i`

              Since the loop guard is `i <= n`, the variable `i` will be incremented until `i = n + 1`, so `i <= n + 1` will hold after loop body. But for the invariant, since `n` arbitrary, we can skip this bound.

              From the postcondition, if `sn <> n` then `sn = 0`. This holds because:

              - If `n < 1`, the loop doesn't execute so `sn = 0`.

              - If `n >= 1`, the loop runs exactly `n` times, so `sn = n`.

              So the invariant `sn = i - 1` together with `1 <= i` is sufficient.

              I'll propose the following invariants:

              - `sn = i - 1`

              - `1 <= i`

              Answer:
              ```
              - "sn = i - 1"
              - "1 <= i"

              Let's analyze why this assertion `if sn <> n then assert { sn = 0 }` fails the proof.

              From the invariants we have:

              - `sn = i - 1`
              - `1 <= i`

              When the loop ends, the guard `i <= n` is false, so `i > n`.

              Therefore, when the loop is done:

              - `i >= n + 1` (since integers)
              - `sn = i - 1 >= n`

              Now, consider the value of `sn` and `n`:

              - If `n < 1`, the loop is never entered (`i = 1`, `i <= n` is false), so `sn = 0` (initialized) and `sn <> n` could be true (if `n < 0` or `n = 0`), and `sn = 0` holds, so assertion is true.

              - If `n >= 1`, the loop executes, increasing `i` until `i = n + 1`, and `sn = i - 1 = n`.

              Therefore, at loop end, we have `sn = n`.

              So `sn <> n` is false, thus the condition of the if statement is false and the assertion is vacuously true.

              Hence, the assertion is true.

              Why then does Why3 fail to prove it?

              Because our invariant does not guarantee `i <= n + 1`. With only `1 <= i` and `sn = i - 1`, the following could happen:

              - For a negative n (say, `n = -5`), we have `i = 1 > n = -5`, so loop not entered, `sn = 0`. So, `if sn <> n` is `if 0 <> -5` true, and assertion expects `sn = 0`, which holds.

              - For `n >= 1`, `i` grows up to `n+1`, so `sn = n` and `sn <> n` is false.

              But because we don't have an upper bound on `i`, we might not be able to conclude formally.

              So we need to express the inequality `i <= n + 1` but only when the loop can run.

              The problem addressed in the earlier feedback was to prove the invariant `i <= n + 1` initially.

              Our analysis in the first feedback was that `i <= n + 1` initially does not hold if `n` is negative since `1 <= n + 1` means `n >= 0`.

              But wait, the loop guard is `i <= n`; if `n < 1`, the loop is not entered and `sn = 0`.

              Therefore, we can modify the invariant `i <= n + 1` and make it conditional:

              `i <= n + 1 || n < 1`

              This disjunction holds initially because if `n < 1`, then this is true, else `i = 1 <= n + 1` if `n >= 1`.

              This also helps with the loop.

              Thus, let's propose the invariants:

              - `sn = i - 1`

              - `1 <= i`

              - `i <= n + 1 || n < 1`

              This last invariant is a disjunction but allowed as it is a logical combination of linear inequalities.

          Let's analyze the situation carefully:

          We are asked to prove: if `sn <> n` then `sn = 0`.

          From the invariants:

          - `sn = i - 1`
          - `1 <= i`
          - `i <= n + 1 || n < 1`

          At loop exit, loop condition `i <= n` is false, so `i > n`.

          Thus:

          - `i >= n + 1`.

          Because `i` is integer and `i > n`.

          Hence:

          - `i = n + 1` or possibly greater.

          Using the invariant `i <= n + 1 || n < 1`:

          - If `n >= 1`, then `i <= n + 1` must hold.

          - If `n < 1`, then the invariant holds regardless of `i`.

          Therefore, at loop exit:

          - If `n >= 1`, then `i` satisfies `1 <= i <= n + 1`.

          - And also, `i > n` since loop ended.

          Thus, `i = n + 1`.

          Using `sn = i - 1`, then `sn = n`.

          Hence, `sn = n` at loop exit if `n >= 1`.

          Else, if `n < 1`, the loop does not execute and `sn = 0`.

          Therefore, at loop exit:

          - If `n < 1`, then `sn = 0`.

          - If `n >= 1`, then `sn = n`.

          Hence, if `sn <> n`, then `n < 1` and `sn = 0`.

          Therefore, assertion `if sn <> n then sn = 0` holds.

          Why then does Why3 fail?

          Presumably because it cannot prove that the loop exit implies `i >= n + 1` and that `sn = i - 1`.

          But from the loop condition and invariants, this should be provable.

          Therefore, to help Why3, let's propose an explicit invariant stating `i > n` after the loop.

          But since the loop guard is `i <= n`, the negation is `i > n` at loop exit.

          We can express as an invariant that the loop guard or its negation relates to `i` and `n`.

          Since the invariant requires to hold before and after an iteration, let's propose the idea that:

          - Before an iteration: `i <= n`

          - After an iteration: `i` is incremented, so `i <= n + 1`

          Let's note:

          - The loop starts with `i <= n` (guard true)

          - Inside the loop body: `i` increments by 1

          So after loop body, `i` increases by 1, so `i <= n + 1`

          Also, at loop exit `i > n`.

          So we can add invariant:

          - `i - 1 <= n`

          Which is equivalent to:

          - `sn = i - 1` (from previous invariant)

          - So `sn <= n`

          This is safe because `sn` counts the iterations which can't surpass `n`.

          Therefore, let's try invariants:

          - `sn = i - 1`

          - `1 <= i`

          - `sn <= n`

          This is simpler than previously and should imply the postcondition.

          Let's check initial conditions:

          - Initially, `sn = 0`, `i = 1`, so `sn = i - 1` holds.

          - Also, `sn <= n` is then `0 <= n`, which holds if `n >= 0`, but if `n` can be negative, not necessarily.

          To handle this, we can weaken `sn <= n || n < 0`.

          Thus, proposing:

          - `sn = i - 1`

          - `1 <= i`

          - `(sn <= n) || (n < 0)`

          Again, this is a linear disjunction allowed by the problem.

          Therefore, answer:

          ```
          - "sn = i - 1"
          - "1 <= i"
          - "sn <= n || n < 0"
