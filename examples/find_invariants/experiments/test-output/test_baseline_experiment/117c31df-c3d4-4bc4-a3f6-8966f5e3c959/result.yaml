                  Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

                  We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear** arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT** propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y * (y + 1)`.

                  I will show you a Why3 program with a single loop and a final assertion. The goal is to prove this assertion by providing a sequence of loop invariants. As a reminder, an invariant is a formula that holds initially and that is preserved by the loop body (it is true at the end of an iteration if it is true at the start). Your job is to find a list of invariants that together imply the final assertion.

                  Please reason carefully and then finish your answer with a YAML object surrounded by triple quotes that denotes a list of invariants. If you make a mistake (your suggested invariants do not imply the postcondition, an invariant does not hold initially or could not be proved to be preserved), I will show you the failing proof obligations and you'll have a chance to answer again. If there

                  ## Why3 Feedback

                  If there is a syntax error in your answer, I'll give you Why3's error message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be proved, we'll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:

                  - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants
                  - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially
                  - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may be needed to complete the proof)

                  In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).

                  ## Advice

                  Here is some advice for finding invariants:

                  - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.
                  - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.
                  - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body, it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.
                  - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for `c` a constant.
                  - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.
                  - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as an invariant instead.
                  - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.
                  - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).

                    Why is `x <> y` always true at the end of the program? It is true initially since `y = 3` and `x < 0`. What happens in the loop body then? `x` is incremented and `y` is incremented if and only if the conditional guard `z < 0` evaluates to true. When does this happen? `z` is 0 initially and is only decremented afterwards. Thus, `z <= 0` is an invariant and the conditional statement always executes (since it does if and only if `z - 1 < 0` at the start of the loop iteration). Thus, `x` and `y` are always incremented by 1 at each iteration and so `x <> y` is preserved.

                    Answer:
                    ```
                    - "x <> y"

                    Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.

                    We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.

                    We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

                    Answer:
                    ```
                    - "3*x - 2*y >= 6"

                    The final assertion is guarded by assumption `n > 0`. However, `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global assumption for now.

                    Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption) and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g >= 1` true.

                    However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally. But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant instead.

                    Answer:
                    ```
                    - "n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)"

                  The final assertion is `x >= y`. This is not true initially. However, it is true at the end of any loop iteration. Thus, `x >= y || y < 100000` is an invariant. However, this invariant is only true assuming the loop guard `y < 100000` is true. But this guard is only true initially, not after the loop. Thus, we propose `y < 100000 -> (x >= y || y < 100000)` as an invariant instead.

                  Since `y` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, we have `y <= 100000` at the end of any loop iteration. Since it is also true initially, we propose `y <= 100000` as an invariant.

                    Why is `x <> y` always true at the end of the program? It is true initially since `y = 3` and `x < 0`. What happens in the loop body then? `x` is incremented and `y` is incremented if and only if the conditional guard `z < 0` evaluates to true. When does this happen? `z` is 0 initially and is only decremented afterwards. Thus, `z <= 0` is an invariant and the conditional statement always executes (since it does if and only if `z - 1 < 0` at the start of the loop iteration). Thus, `x` and `y` are always incremented by 1 at each iteration and so `x <> y` is preserved.

                    Answer:
                    ```
                    - "x <> y"
                    - "z <= 0"

                    Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.

                    We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.

                    We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

                    Answer:
                    ```

                    The final assertion is guarded by assumption `n > 0`. However, `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global assumption for now.

                    Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption) and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g >= 1` true.

                    However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally. But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant instead.

                    Answer:

                    The final assertion is `x >= y`. This is not true initially. However, it is true at the end of any loop iteration. Thus, `x >= y || y < 100000` is an invariant. However, this invariant is only true assuming the loop guard `y < 100000` is true. But this guard is only true initially, not after the loop. Thus, we propose `y < 100000 -> (x >= y || y < 100000)` as an invariant instead.

                    Since `y` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, we have `y <= 100000` at the end of any loop iteration. Since it is also true initially, we propose `y <= 100000` as an invariant.

                  I see, the problem is that the invariant `y < 100000 -> (x >= y || y < 100000)` does not imply the final assertion `x >= y` when `y >= 100000`.

                  The reason is that the invariant `y < 100000 -> (x >= y || y < 100000)` does not say anything about the case when `y >= 100000`. We need an invariant that implies `x >= y` when `y >= 100000`.

                  In fact, the invariant `x >= y` is true at the end of any loop iteration. Thus, `x >= y || y < 100000` is an invariant. However, this invariant is only true assuming the loop guard `y < 100000` is true. But this guard is only true initially, not after the loop. Thus, we propose `y < 100000 -> (x >= y || y < 100000)` as an invariant instead.

                  Since `y` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, we have `y <= 100000` at the end of any loop iteration. Since it is also true initially, we propose `y <= 100000` as an invariant.

                  Finally, we need an invariant that implies `x >= y` when `y >= 100000`. Since `y` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, we have `x >= y - 100000` at the end of any loop iteration. Since it is also true initially, we propose `x >= y - 100000` as an invariant.

                  Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

                  We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear** arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT** propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y * (y + 1)`.

                  I will show you a Why3 program with a single loop and a final assertion. The goal is to prove this assertion by providing a sequence of loop invariants. As a reminder, an invariant is a formula that holds initially and that is preserved by the loop body (it is true at the end of an iteration if it is true at the start). Your job is to find a list of invariants that together imply the final assertion.

                  Please reason carefully and then finish your answer with a YAML object surrounded by triple quotes that denotes a list of invariants. If you make a mistake (your suggested invariants do not imply the postcondition, an invariant does not hold initially or could not be proved to be preserved), I will show you the failing proof obligations and you'll have a chance to answer again. If there

                  ## Why3 Feedback

                  If there is a syntax error in your answer, I'll give you Why3's error message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be proved, we'll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:

                  - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants
                  - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially
                  - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may be needed to complete the proof)

                  In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).

                  ## Advice

                  Here is some advice for finding invariants:

                  - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.
                  - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.
                  - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body, it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.
                  - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for `c` a constant.
                  - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.
                  - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as an invariant instead.
                  - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.
                  - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).

                    Why is `x <> y` always true at the end of the program? It is true initially since `y = 3` and `x < 0`. What happens in the loop body then? `x` is incremented and `y` is incremented if and only if the conditional guard `z < 0` evaluates to true. When does this happen? `z` is 0 initially and is only decremented afterwards. Thus, `z <= 0` is an invariant and the conditional statement always executes (since it does if and only if `z - 1 < 0` at the start of the loop iteration). Thus, `x` and `y` are always incremented by 1 at each iteration and so `x <> y` is preserved.

                    Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.

                    We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.

                    We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

                    The final assertion is guarded by assumption `n > 0`. However, `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global assumption for now.

                    Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption) and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g >= 1` true.

                    However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally. But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant instead.

                    The final assertion is `x >= y`. This is not true initially. However, it is true at the end of any loop iteration. Thus, `x >= y || y < 100000` is an invariant. However, this invariant is only true assuming the loop guard `y < 100000` is true. But this guard is only true initially, not after the loop. Thus, we propose `y < 100000 -> (x >= y || y < 100000)` as an invariant instead.

                    Since `y` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, we have `y <= 100000` at the end of any loop iteration. Since it is also true initially, we propose `y <= 100000` as an invariant.

                    I see, the problem is that the invariant `y < 100000 -> (x >= y || y < 100000)` does not imply the final assertion `x >= y` when `y >= 100000`.

                    The reason is that the invariant `y < 100000 -> (x >= y || y < 100000)` does not say anything about the case when `y >= 100000`. We need an invariant that implies `x >= y` when `y >= 100000`.

                    In fact, the invariant `x >= y` is true at the end of any loop iteration. Thus, `x >= y || y < 100000` is an invariant. However, this invariant is only true assuming the loop guard `y < 100000` is true. But this guard is only true initially, not after the loop. Thus, we propose `y < 100000 -> (x >= y || y < 100000)` as an invariant instead.

                    Since `y` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, we have `y <= 100000` at the end of any loop iteration. Since it is also true initially, we propose `y <= 100000` as an invariant.

                    Finally, we need an invariant that implies `x >= y` when `y >= 100000`. Since `y` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, we have `x >= y - 100000` at the end of any loop iteration. Since it is also true initially, we propose `x >= y - 100000` as an invariant.

                    Answer:
                    ```

                  The invariant `x >= y - 100000` cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body. The reason is that, in the loop body, `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`. This means that the invariant `x >= y - 100000` is not preserved because `x` is not incremented by enough to keep up with `y`.

                  Let's try a different approach. We need an invariant that captures the relationship between `x` and `y` more accurately. Since `x` is incremented by `y` at each step, we can express `x` in terms of `y`.

                  Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`. After the first iteration, `x = 1 + 0 = 1` and `y = 1`. After the second iteration, `x = 1 + 1 = 2` and `y = 2`. We can see a pattern here: `x` is the sum of the first `y` natural numbers.

                  The sum of the first `y` natural numbers is given by the formula `y * (y + 1) / 2`. However, since we are not allowed to use complex arithmetic, we need to find a simpler invariant.

                  Let's consider the invariant `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2`. This invariant captures the relationship between `x` and `y` accurately. However, we are not allowed to use complex arithmetic. So, we need to find a simpler invariant.

                  Let's consider the invariant `x >= y * y`. This invariant is too strong and does not hold initially. So, we need to find a weaker invariant.

                  Let's consider the invariant `x >= y * (y - 1) / 2`. This invariant is too strong and does not hold initially. So, we need to find a weaker invariant.

                The invariant `x >= y - 100000` cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body. The reason is that, in the loop body, `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`. This means that the invariant `x >= y - 100000` is not preserved because `x` is not incremented by enough to keep up with `y`.

                Let's try a different approach. We need an invariant that captures the relationship between `x` and `y` more accurately. Since `x` is incremented by `y` at each step, we can express `x` in terms of `y`.

                Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`. After the first iteration, `x = 1 + 0 = 1` and `y = 1`. After the second iteration, `x = 1 + 1 = 2` and `y = 2`. We can see a pattern here: `x` is the sum of the first `y` natural numbers.

                The sum of the first `y` natural numbers is given by the formula `y * (y + 1) / 2`. However, since we are not allowed to use complex arithmetic, we need to find a simpler invariant.
