              ## Advice


              Here is some advice for finding invariants:


              - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final
              assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body,
              it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that
              serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants
              are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.

              - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an
              invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for
              `c` a constant.

              - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved
              as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing
              `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.

              - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption
              `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum
              -> inv` as an invariant instead.

              - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving
              that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken),
              consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.

              - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr`
              an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase
              more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing
              `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).'

                We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the
                previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function
                of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.


                We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop

                `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global

                Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily
                true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true
                (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since
                `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption)
                and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard
                `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g

                We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the

                We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop

                Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily
                true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true
                (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since
                `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption)
                and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard

              automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.


              We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear**

              message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be
              proved, we''ll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides
              a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:


              - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants

              - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially

              - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be
              preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional
              invariant may be needed to complete the proof)


              In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of
              the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved
              (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions
              (`premise`).


              ## Advice


              Here is some advice for finding invariants:


              - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final
              assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body,
              it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that
              serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants
              are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.

              - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an
              invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for
              `c` a constant.

              - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved
              as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing
              `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.

              - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption
              `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum
              -> inv` as an invariant instead.

              - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving
              that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken),
              consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.

              - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr`
              an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase
              more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing
              `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).'

                We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the
                previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function
                of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.


                We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop
                iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at
                the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because
                of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

                `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global
                assumption for now.


                Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily
                true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true
                (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since
                `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption)
                and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard
                `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g
                >= 1` true.


                However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally.
                But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose
                `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant instead.

              automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be
              proved, we''ll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides
              a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:


              - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants

              - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially

              - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be
              preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional
              invariant may be needed to complete the proof)


              In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of
              the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved
              (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions
              (`premise`).


              ## Advice


              Here is some advice for finding invariants:


              - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final
              assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body,
              it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that
              serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants
              are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.

              - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an
              invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for
              `c` a constant.

              - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved
              as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing
              `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.

                We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop

                Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily
                true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true
                (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since
                `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption)
                and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard

              holds after each iteration of the loop. Let''s analyze the loop body:


              1. Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x >= 2*y` holds.

              2. In each iteration, `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is updated to
              `y + 1`.


              To preserve the invariant `x >= 2*y`, we need to show that after these
              updates, `x + y >= 2*(y + 1)`.


              Let''s break it down:

              - Before the update: `x >= 2*y`

              - After the update: `x + y >= 2*(y + 1)`


              Simplifying `2*(y + 1)` gives us `2*y + 2`. So, we need to show that
              `x + y >= 2*y + 2`.


              This simplifies to `x >= 2*y + 2 - y`, which further simplifies to `x
              >= y + 2`.


              Given that `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`,
              we need a stronger invariant that ensures `x` grows faster than `y`.


              Let''s try a different invariant: `x >= y + y`. This invariant holds
              initially because `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `1 >= 0 + 0` is true.


              Now, let''s check if this invariant is preserved:

              - Before the update: `x >= y + y`

              - After the update: `x + y >= (y + 1) + (y + 1)`


              Simplifying `(y + 1) + (y + 1)` gives us `2*y + 2`. So, we need to show
              that `x + y >= 2*y + 2`.


              This simplifies to `x >= y + 2`, which we have already established as
              a necessary condition.


              Thus, the invariant `x >= 2*y + y` should hold.
