              If there is a syntax error in your answer, I''ll give you Why3''s error
              message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be
              proved, we''ll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides
              a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:


              - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants

              - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially

              - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be
              preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional
              invariant may be needed to complete the proof)


              In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of
              the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved
              (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions
              (`premise`).


              ## Advice


              Here is some advice for finding invariants:


              - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final
              assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body,
              it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that
              serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants
              are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.

              - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an
              invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for
              `c` a constant.

              - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved
              as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing
              `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.

              - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption
              `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum
              -> inv` as an invariant instead.

              - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving
              that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken),
              consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.

              - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr`
              an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase
              more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing
              `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).'

                We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the

                of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.


                We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop

                `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global
                assumption for now.


                Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily
                true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true
                (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since
                `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption)
                and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard
                `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g

                However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally.

              In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of
              the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved
              (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions
              (`premise`).


              ## Advice


              Here is some advice for finding invariants:


              - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final
              assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body,
              it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that
              serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants
              are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.

              - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an
              invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for
              `c` a constant.

              - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved
              as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing
              `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.

              - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption
              `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum
              -> inv` as an invariant instead.

              - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving
              that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken),
              consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.

              - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr`
              an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase
              more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing
              `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).'

                We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the

                We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop

                `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global
                assumption for now.


                Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily
                true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true
                (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since
                `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption)
                and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard
                `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g

                However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally.

                \ `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x >= y` holds.\n   - After the first iteration,\
                \ `x = 1 + 0 = 1` and `y = 1`, so `x >= y` does not hold.\n\nSince\

                \ that implies `x >= y` when `y >= 100000`.\n\n2. **Invariant Proposal**:\n\
                \   - Let's consider the expression `x - y`. Initially, `x - y = 1\
                \ - 0 = 1`.\n   - After each iteration, `x` is updated to `x + y`,\
                \ and `y` is incremented by `1`. Thus, the change in `x - y` is `x\
                \ + y - (y + 1) = x - 1`.\n   - Therefore, `x - y` decreases by `1`\
                \ at each iteration.\n\nSince `x - y` starts at `1` and decreases\
                \ by `1` at each iteration, we can propose the invariant `x - y >=\
                \ -(y - 100000)`.\n\nThis invariant implies `x >= y` when `y >= 100000`\

              ## Why3 Feedback


              If there is a syntax error in your answer, I''ll give you Why3''s error
              message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be
              proved, we''ll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides
              a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:


              - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants

              - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially

              - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be
              preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional
              invariant may be needed to complete the proof)


              In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of
              the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved
              (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions
              (`premise`).


              ## Advice


              Here is some advice for finding invariants:


              - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final
              assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body,
              it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that
              serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants
              are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.

              - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an
              invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for
              `c` a constant.

              - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved
              as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing
              `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.

              - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption
              `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum
              -> inv` as an invariant instead.

              - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving
              that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken),
              consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.

              - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr`
              an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase
              more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing
              `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).'

                We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the

                of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.


                We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop
                iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at

                `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global
                assumption for now.


                Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily
                true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true
                (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since
                `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption)
                and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard
                `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g
                >= 1` true.


                However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally.

                \ `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x >= y` holds.\n   - After the first iteration,\
                \ `x = 1 + 0 = 1` and `y = 1`, so `x >= y` does not hold.\n\nSince\

                \   - Let's consider the expression `x - y`. Initially, `x - y = 1\
                \ - 0 = 1`.\n   - After each iteration, `x` is updated to `x + y`,\
                \ and `y` is incremented by `1`. Thus, the change in `x - y` is `x\
                \ + y - (y + 1) = x - 1`.\n   - Therefore, `x - y` decreases by `1`\
                \ at each iteration.\n\nSince `x - y` starts at `1` and decreases\
                \ by `1` at each iteration, we can propose the invariant `x - y >=\
                \ -(y - 100000)`.\n\nThis invariant implies `x >= y` when `y >= 100000`\

              the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop
              invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved
              automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.


              We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear**
              arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication
              by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x
              + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y *
              (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT**
              propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y
              * (y + 1)`.


              I will show you a Why3 program with a single loop and a final assertion.
              The goal is to prove this assertion by providing a sequence of loop
              invariants. As a reminder, an invariant is a formula that holds initially
              and that is preserved by the loop body (it is true at the end of an
              iteration if it is true at the start). Your job is to find a list of
              invariants that together imply the final assertion.

              surrounded by triple quotes that denotes a list of invariants. If you
              make a mistake (your suggested invariants do not imply the postcondition,

              ## Why3 Feedback


              If there is a syntax error in your answer, I''ll give you Why3''s error
              message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be
              proved, we''ll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides
              a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:


              - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants

              - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially

              - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be
              preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional
              invariant may be needed to complete the proof)


              In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of
              the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved
              (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions
              (`premise`).


              ## Advice


              Here is some advice for finding invariants:


              - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final
              assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body,
              it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that
              serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants
              are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.

              - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an
              invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for
              `c` a constant.

              - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved
              as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing
              `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.

              - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption
              `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum
              -> inv` as an invariant instead.

              - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving
              that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken),
              consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.

              - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr`
              an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase
              more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing
              `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).'

                We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop

                Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily
                true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true
                (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since
                `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption)
                and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard

                \ and `y` is incremented by `1`. Thus, the change in `x - y` is `x\
                \ + y - (y + 1) = x - 1`.\n   - Therefore, `x - y` decreases by `1`\
                \ at each iteration.\n\nSince `x - y` starts at `1` and decreases\
                \ by `1` at each iteration, we can propose the invariant `x - y >=\

              \ updates.\n\n- Before the update: `x >= 2*y`\n- After updating `x`:\
              \ `x' = x + y`\n- After updating `y`: `y' = y + 1`\n\nWe need to show\

              \ Since `x >= 2*y` holds before the update, adding `y` to both sides\

              \ `x >= 2*y - 1`. This invariant holds initially because `x = 1` and\
              \ `y = 0`. We need to check if this invariant is preserved by the loop\
              \ body.\n\n### Checking Preservation\n\n1. **Initial Values**:\n   -\
