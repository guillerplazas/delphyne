                  Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

                  We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear** arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT** propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y * (y + 1)`.

                  I will show you a Why3 program with a single loop and a final assertion. The goal is to prove this assertion by providing a sequence of loop invariants. As a reminder, an invariant is a formula that holds initially and that is preserved by the loop body (it is true at the end of an iteration if it is true at the start). Your job is to find a list of invariants that together imply the final assertion.

                  Please reason carefully and then finish your answer with a YAML object surrounded by triple quotes that denotes a list of invariants. If you make a mistake (your suggested invariants do not imply the postcondition, an invariant does not hold initially or could not be proved to be preserved), I will show you the failing proof obligations and you'll have a chance to answer again. If there

                  ## Why3 Feedback

                  If there is a syntax error in your answer, I'll give you Why3's error message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be proved, we'll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:

                  - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants
                  - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially
                  - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may be needed to complete the proof)

                  In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).

                  ## Advice

                  Here is some advice for finding invariants:

                  - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.
                  - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.
                  - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body, it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.
                  - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for `c` a constant.
                  - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.
                  - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as an invariant instead.
                  - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.
                  - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).

                    Why is `x <> y` always true at the end of the program? It is true initially since `y = 3` and `x < 0`. What happens in the loop body then? `x` is incremented and `y` is incremented if and only if the conditional guard `z < 0` evaluates to true. When does this happen? `z` is 0 initially and is only decremented afterwards. Thus, `z <= 0` is an invariant and the conditional statement always executes (since it does if and only if `z - 1 < 0` at the start of the loop iteration). Thus, `x` and `y` are always incremented by 1 at each iteration and so `x <> y` is preserved.

                    Answer:
                    ```
                    - "x <> y"

                    Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.

                    We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.

                    We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

                    ```
                    - "3*x - 2*y >= 6"

                    The final assertion is guarded by assumption `n > 0`. However, `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global assumption for now.

                    Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption) and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g >= 1` true.

                    However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally. But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant instead.

                    Answer:
                    ```

                  To prove the final assertion `x >= y`, we need to establish an invariant that holds throughout the loop and implies the assertion when the loop terminates.

                  We need to find an invariant that is true initially and preserved by the loop body. Let's analyze the loop:

                  - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`.
                  - The loop guard is `y < 100000`.
                  - In each iteration, `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`.

                  We want to prove `x >= y` at the end of the loop. Notice that `x` is always greater than or equal to `y` because `x` is incremented by `y` in each iteration. Therefore, `x - y` is non-decreasing.

                  Let's propose the invariant `x >= y`. This invariant must hold initially and be preserved by the loop body.

                  - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x >= y` holds.
                  - In the loop body, `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is updated to `y + 1`. We need to show that `x + y >= y + 1` holds, which simplifies to `x >= 1`. Since `x` starts at `1` and is always incremented by a positive value `y`, `x >= 1` holds throughout the loop.

                  Thus, the invariant `x >= y` is preserved by the loop body.

                  Answer:
                  ```
                  - "x >= y"

                    Why is `x <> y` always true at the end of the program? It is true initially since `y = 3` and `x < 0`. What happens in the loop body then? `x` is incremented and `y` is incremented if and only if the conditional guard `z < 0` evaluates to true. When does this happen? `z` is 0 initially and is only decremented afterwards. Thus, `z <= 0` is an invariant and the conditional statement always executes (since it does if and only if `z - 1 < 0` at the start of the loop iteration). Thus, `x` and `y` are always incremented by 1 at each iteration and so `x <> y` is preserved.

                    Answer:
                    ```
                    - "x <> y"
                    - "z <= 0"

                    Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.

                    We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.

                    We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

                    Answer:
                    ```

                    The final assertion is guarded by assumption `n > 0`. However, `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global assumption for now.

                    Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption) and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g >= 1` true.

                    However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally. But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant instead.

                    Answer:

                    To prove the final assertion `x >= y`, we need to establish an invariant that holds throughout the loop and implies the assertion when the loop terminates.

                    We need to find an invariant that is true initially and preserved by the loop body. Let's analyze the loop:

                    - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`.
                    - The loop guard is `y < 100000`.
                    - In each iteration, `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`.

                    We want to prove `x >= y` at the end of the loop. Notice that `x` is always greater than or equal to `y` because `x` is incremented by `y` in each iteration. Therefore, `x - y` is non-decreasing.

                    Let's propose the invariant `x >= y`. This invariant must hold initially and be preserved by the loop body.

                    - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x >= y` holds.
                    - In the loop body, `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is updated to `y + 1`. We need to show that `x + y >= y + 1` holds, which simplifies to `x >= 1`. Since `x` starts at `1` and is always incremented by a positive value `y`, `x >= 1` holds throughout the loop.

                    Thus, the invariant `x >= y` is preserved by the loop body.

                    Answer:
                    ```
                    - "x >= y"

                  To address the failed proof obligation, we need to ensure that the invariant `x >= y` is preserved by the loop body. Let's carefully analyze the loop body and the invariant.

                  The loop body updates `x` to `x + y` and `y` to `y + 1`. We need to show that `x + y >= y + 1` holds, which simplifies to `x >= 1`. However, this is not sufficient because `x` can be less than 1 if `y` is negative initially.

                  To ensure that `x >= y` is preserved, we need to consider the initial values and the loop updates more carefully. Let's propose additional invariants that capture the relationship between `x` and `y` more precisely.

                  Given that `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1` in each iteration, we can derive that `x` will always be greater than or equal to `y` plus the number of iterations. However, since `y` starts at `0` and is incremented by `1` each time, `x` will always be greater than or equal to `y` plus the number of iterations times `1`.

                  Let's propose the invariant `x >= y + y`. This invariant captures the fact that `x` is incremented by `y` in each iteration, and `y` is incremented by `1` each time.

                  - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x >= y + y` holds.
                  - In the loop body, `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is updated to `y + 1`. We need to show that `x + y >= (y + 1) + (y + 1)`, which simplifies to `x >= y + 1`. Since `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`, this holds.

                  However, this invariant is too strong and does not hold initially. Let's propose a weaker invariant that captures the essential relationship: `x >= y`.

                  To ensure that `x >= y` is preserved, we need to consider the initial values and the loop updates more carefully. Let's propose the invariant `x - y >= 1`. This invariant captures the fact that `x` is always at least `1` more than `y`.

                  - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x - y >= 1` holds.
                  - In the loop body, `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is updated to `y + 1`. We need to show that `(x + y) - (y + 1) >= 1`, which simplifies to `x - 1 >= 1`. Since `x` starts at `1` and is always incremented by a positive value `y`, `x - 1 >= 1` holds throughout the loop.

                  Thus, the invariant `x - y >= 1` is preserved by the loop body.

                  ```

                  Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

                  We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear** arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT** propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y * (y + 1)`.

                  I will show you a Why3 program with a single loop and a final assertion. The goal is to prove this assertion by providing a sequence of loop invariants. As a reminder, an invariant is a formula that holds initially and that is preserved by the loop body (it is true at the end of an iteration if it is true at the start). Your job is to find a list of invariants that together imply the final assertion.

                  Please reason carefully and then finish your answer with a YAML object surrounded by triple quotes that denotes a list of invariants. If you make a mistake (your suggested invariants do not imply the postcondition, an invariant does not hold initially or could not be proved to be preserved), I will show you the failing proof obligations and you'll have a chance to answer again. If there

                  ## Why3 Feedback

                  If there is a syntax error in your answer, I'll give you Why3's error message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be proved, we'll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:

                  - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants
                  - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially
                  - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may be needed to complete the proof)

                  In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).

                  ## Advice

                  Here is some advice for finding invariants:

                  - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.
                  - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.
                  - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body, it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.
                  - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for `c` a constant.
                  - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.
                  - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as an invariant instead.
                  - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.
                  - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).

                    Why is `x <> y` always true at the end of the program? It is true initially since `y = 3` and `x < 0`. What happens in the loop body then? `x` is incremented and `y` is incremented if and only if the conditional guard `z < 0` evaluates to true. When does this happen? `z` is 0 initially and is only decremented afterwards. Thus, `z <= 0` is an invariant and the conditional statement always executes (since it does if and only if `z - 1 < 0` at the start of the loop iteration). Thus, `x` and `y` are always incremented by 1 at each iteration and so `x <> y` is preserved.

                    Answer:
                    ```
                    - "x <> y"
                    - "z <= 0"

                    Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.

                    We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.

                    We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

                    Answer:
                    ```
                    - "3*x - 2*y >= 6"

                    The final assertion is guarded by assumption `n > 0`. However, `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global assumption for now.

                    Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption) and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g >= 1` true.

                    However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally. But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant instead.

                    Answer:
                    ```

                    To prove the final assertion `x >= y`, we need to establish an invariant that holds throughout the loop and implies the assertion when the loop terminates.

                    We need to find an invariant that is true initially and preserved by the loop body. Let's analyze the loop:

                    - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`.
                    - The loop guard is `y < 100000`.
                    - In each iteration, `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`.

                    We want to prove `x >= y` at the end of the loop. Notice that `x` is always greater than or equal to `y` because `x` is incremented by `y` in each iteration. Therefore, `x - y` is non-decreasing.

                    Let's propose the invariant `x >= y`. This invariant must hold initially and be preserved by the loop body.

                    - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x >= y` holds.
                    - In the loop body, `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is updated to `y + 1`. We need to show that `x + y >= y + 1` holds, which simplifies to `x >= 1`. Since `x` starts at `1` and is always incremented by a positive value `y`, `x >= 1` holds throughout the loop.

                    Thus, the invariant `x >= y` is preserved by the loop body.

                    ```

                    To address the failed proof obligation, we need to ensure that the invariant `x >= y` is preserved by the loop body. Let's carefully analyze the loop body and the invariant.

                    The loop body updates `x` to `x + y` and `y` to `y + 1`. We need to show that `x + y >= y + 1` holds, which simplifies to `x >= 1`. However, this is not sufficient because `x` can be less than 1 if `y` is negative initially.

                    To ensure that `x >= y` is preserved, we need to consider the initial values and the loop updates more carefully. Let's propose additional invariants that capture the relationship between `x` and `y` more precisely.

                    Given that `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1` in each iteration, we can derive that `x` will always be greater than or equal to `y` plus the number of iterations. However, since `y` starts at `0` and is incremented by `1` each time, `x` will always be greater than or equal to `y` plus the number of iterations times `1`.

                    Let's propose the invariant `x >= y + y`. This invariant captures the fact that `x` is incremented by `y` in each iteration, and `y` is incremented by `1` each time.

                    - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x >= y + y` holds.
                    - In the loop body, `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is updated to `y + 1`. We need to show that `x + y >= (y + 1) + (y + 1)`, which simplifies to `x >= y + 1`. Since `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`, this holds.

                    However, this invariant is too strong and does not hold initially. Let's propose a weaker invariant that captures the essential relationship: `x >= y`.

                    To ensure that `x >= y` is preserved, we need to consider the initial values and the loop updates more carefully. Let's propose the invariant `x - y >= 1`. This invariant captures the fact that `x` is always at least `1` more than `y`.

                    - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x - y >= 1` holds.
                    - In the loop body, `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is updated to `y + 1`. We need to show that `(x + y) - (y + 1) >= 1`, which simplifies to `x - 1 >= 1`. Since `x` starts at `1` and is always incremented by a positive value `y`, `x - 1 >= 1` holds throughout the loop.

                    Thus, the invariant `x - y >= 1` is preserved by the loop body.

                    Answer:
                    ```
                    - "x - y >= 1"

                  I see the issue now. The invariant `x - y >= 1` does not hold initially because `x` and `y` are both initialized to `1` and `0`, respectively. We need to find an invariant that holds initially and is preserved by the loop body.

                  Let's re-evaluate the loop and the invariant. We need an invariant that captures the relationship between `x` and `y` such that `x >= y` holds at the end of the loop.

                  Given the loop body:
                  - `x <- x + y`
                  - `y <- y + 1`

                  We need an invariant that is true initially and preserved by these updates. Let's consider the invariant `x >= y + y`. This invariant captures the fact that `x` is always at least twice `y`.

                  - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x >= y + y` holds because `1 >= 0 + 0`.
                  - In the loop body, `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is updated to `y + 1`. We need to show that `x + y >= (y + 1) + (y + 1)`, which simplifies to `x >= y + 2`. Since `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`, this holds.

                  However, this invariant is too strong and does not hold initially. Let's propose a weaker invariant that captures the essential relationship: `x >= y`.

                  To ensure that `x >= y` is preserved, we need to consider the initial values and the loop updates more carefully. Let's propose the invariant `x >= y + y`. This invariant captures the fact that `x` is always at least twice `y`.

                  - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x >= y + y` holds because `1 >= 0 + 0`.
                  - In the loop body, `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is updated to `y + 1`. We need to show that `x + y >= (y + 1) + (y + 1)`, which simplifies to `x >= y + 2`. Since `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`, this holds.

                  However, this invariant is too strong and does not hold initially. Let's propose a weaker invariant that captures the essential relationship: `x >= y`.

                  To ensure that `x >= y` is preserved, we need to consider the initial values and the loop updates more carefully. Let's propose the invariant `x - y >= 0`. This invariant captures the fact that `x` is always greater than or equal to `y`.

                  - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x - y >= 0` holds because `1 - 0 >= 0`.
                  - In the loop body, `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is updated to `y + 1`. We need to show that `(x + y) - (y + 1) >= 0`, which simplifies to `x - 1 >= 0`. Since `x` starts at `1` and is always incremented by a positive value `y`, `x - 1 >= 0` holds throughout the loop.

                  Thus, the invariant `x - y >= 0` is preserved by the loop body.

                  Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

                  We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear** arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT** propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y * (y + 1)`.

                  I will show you a Why3 program with a single loop and a final assertion. The goal is to prove this assertion by providing a sequence of loop invariants. As a reminder, an invariant is a formula that holds initially and that is preserved by the loop body (it is true at the end of an iteration if it is true at the start). Your job is to find a list of invariants that together imply the final assertion.

                  Please reason carefully and then finish your answer with a YAML object surrounded by triple quotes that denotes a list of invariants. If you make a mistake (your suggested invariants do not imply the postcondition, an invariant does not hold initially or could not be proved to be preserved), I will show you the failing proof obligations and you'll have a chance to answer again. If there

                  - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants
                  - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially
                  - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may be needed to complete the proof)

                  In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).

                  ## Advice

                  Here is some advice for finding invariants:

                  - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.
                  - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.
                  - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body, it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.
                  - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for `c` a constant.
                  - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.
                  - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as an invariant instead.
                  - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.
                  - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).

                    Why is `x <> y` always true at the end of the program? It is true initially since `y = 3` and `x < 0`. What happens in the loop body then? `x` is incremented and `y` is incremented if and only if the conditional guard `z < 0` evaluates to true. When does this happen? `z` is 0 initially and is only decremented afterwards. Thus, `z <= 0` is an invariant and the conditional statement always executes (since it does if and only if `z - 1 < 0` at the start of the loop iteration). Thus, `x` and `y` are always incremented by 1 at each iteration and so `x <> y` is preserved.

                    Answer:
                    ```
                    - "x <> y"

                    Since `y` is decremented by 3 every time `x` in incremented by `2`, the quantity `3*x - 2*y` is constant throughout the program. Since it at least `3*2 - 2*0 = 6` initially, the inequality "3*x - 2*y >= 6" is an invariant.

                    We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.

                    We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

                    Answer:
                    ```

                    The final assertion is guarded by assumption `n > 0`. However, `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global assumption for now.

                    Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption) and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g >= 1` true.

                    However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally. But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose `n > 0 -> (g >= 1 || x < n)` as an invariant instead.

                    ```

                    To prove the final assertion `x >= y`, we need to establish an invariant that holds throughout the loop and implies the assertion when the loop terminates.

                    We need to find an invariant that is true initially and preserved by the loop body. Let's analyze the loop:

                    - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`.
                    - The loop guard is `y < 100000`.
                    - In each iteration, `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`.

                    We want to prove `x >= y` at the end of the loop. Notice that `x` is always greater than or equal to `y` because `x` is incremented by `y` in each iteration. Therefore, `x - y` is non-decreasing.

                    Let's propose the invariant `x >= y`. This invariant must hold initially and be preserved by the loop body.

                    - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x >= y` holds.
                    - In the loop body, `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is updated to `y + 1`. We need to show that `x + y >= y + 1` holds, which simplifies to `x >= 1`. Since `x` starts at `1` and is always incremented by a positive value `y`, `x >= 1` holds throughout the loop.

                    Thus, the invariant `x >= y` is preserved by the loop body.

                    - "x >= y"

                    To address the failed proof obligation, we need to ensure that the invariant `x >= y` is preserved by the loop body. Let's carefully analyze the loop body and the invariant.

                    The loop body updates `x` to `x + y` and `y` to `y + 1`. We need to show that `x + y >= y + 1` holds, which simplifies to `x >= 1`. However, this is not sufficient because `x` can be less than 1 if `y` is negative initially.

                    To ensure that `x >= y` is preserved, we need to consider the initial values and the loop updates more carefully. Let's propose additional invariants that capture the relationship between `x` and `y` more precisely.

                    Given that `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1` in each iteration, we can derive that `x` will always be greater than or equal to `y` plus the number of iterations. However, since `y` starts at `0` and is incremented by `1` each time, `x` will always be greater than or equal to `y` plus the number of iterations times `1`.

                    Let's propose the invariant `x >= y + y`. This invariant captures the fact that `x` is incremented by `y` in each iteration, and `y` is incremented by `1` each time.

                    - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x >= y + y` holds.
                    - In the loop body, `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is updated to `y + 1`. We need to show that `x + y >= (y + 1) + (y + 1)`, which simplifies to `x >= y + 1`. Since `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`, this holds.

                    However, this invariant is too strong and does not hold initially. Let's propose a weaker invariant that captures the essential relationship: `x >= y`.

                    To ensure that `x >= y` is preserved, we need to consider the initial values and the loop updates more carefully. Let's propose the invariant `x - y >= 1`. This invariant captures the fact that `x` is always at least `1` more than `y`.

                    - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x - y >= 1` holds.
                    - In the loop body, `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is updated to `y + 1`. We need to show that `(x + y) - (y + 1) >= 1`, which simplifies to `x - 1 >= 1`. Since `x` starts at `1` and is always incremented by a positive value `y`, `x - 1 >= 1` holds throughout the loop.

                    Thus, the invariant `x - y >= 1` is preserved by the loop body.

                    ```

                    I see the issue now. The invariant `x - y >= 1` does not hold initially because `x` and `y` are both initialized to `1` and `0`, respectively. We need to find an invariant that holds initially and is preserved by the loop body.

                    Let's re-evaluate the loop and the invariant. We need an invariant that captures the relationship between `x` and `y` such that `x >= y` holds at the end of the loop.

                    Given the loop body:
                    - `x <- x + y`
                    - `y <- y + 1`

                    We need an invariant that is true initially and preserved by these updates. Let's consider the invariant `x >= y + y`. This invariant captures the fact that `x` is always at least twice `y`.

                    - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x >= y + y` holds because `1 >= 0 + 0`.
                    - In the loop body, `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is updated to `y + 1`. We need to show that `x + y >= (y + 1) + (y + 1)`, which simplifies to `x >= y + 2`. Since `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`, this holds.

                    However, this invariant is too strong and does not hold initially. Let's propose a weaker invariant that captures the essential relationship: `x >= y`.

                    To ensure that `x >= y` is preserved, we need to consider the initial values and the loop updates more carefully. Let's propose the invariant `x >= y + y`. This invariant captures the fact that `x` is always at least twice `y`.

                    - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x >= y + y` holds because `1 >= 0 + 0`.
                    - In the loop body, `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is updated to `y + 1`. We need to show that `x + y >= (y + 1) + (y + 1)`, which simplifies to `x >= y + 2`. Since `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`, this holds.

                    However, this invariant is too strong and does not hold initially. Let's propose a weaker invariant that captures the essential relationship: `x >= y`.

                    To ensure that `x >= y` is preserved, we need to consider the initial values and the loop updates more carefully. Let's propose the invariant `x - y >= 0`. This invariant captures the fact that `x` is always greater than or equal to `y`.

                    - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x - y >= 0` holds because `1 - 0 >= 0`.
                    - In the loop body, `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is updated to `y + 1`. We need to show that `(x + y) - (y + 1) >= 0`, which simplifies to `x - 1 >= 0`. Since `x` starts at `1` and is always incremented by a positive value `y`, `x - 1 >= 0` holds throughout the loop.

                    Thus, the invariant `x - y >= 0` is preserved by the loop body.

                  The invariant `x - y >= 0` does not correctly capture the relationship between `x` and `y` in the loop. Let's re-evaluate the loop and find a suitable invariant.

                  The loop body updates `x` to `x + y` and `y` to `y + 1`. We need an invariant that holds initially and is preserved by these updates.

                  Let's consider the invariant `x >= y + y`. This invariant captures the fact that `x` is always at least twice `y`.

                  - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x >= 2 * y` does not hold because `1 >= 2 * 0` is true.
                  - In the loop body, `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is updated to `y + 1`. We need to show that `x + y >= 2 * (y + 1)`, which simplifies to `x >= y + 2`. Since `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`, this holds.

                  However, this invariant is too strong and does not hold initially. Let's propose a weaker invariant that captures the essential relationship: `x - y >= y`.

                  - Initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, so `x - y >= y` holds because `1 - 0 >= 0`.
                  - In the loop body, `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is updated to `y + 1`. We need to show that `(x + y) - (y + 1) >= y + 1`, which simplifies to `x - 1 >= y + 1`. Since `x` starts at `1` and is always incremented by a positive value `y`, `x - 1 >= y + 1` holds throughout the loop.

                  Thus, the invariant `x - y >= y` is preserved by the loop body.

                  Answer:
                  ```
                  - "x - y >= y"
