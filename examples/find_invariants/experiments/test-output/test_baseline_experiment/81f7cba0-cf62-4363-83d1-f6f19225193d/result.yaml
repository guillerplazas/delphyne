              ## Advice


              Here is some advice for finding invariants:


              - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final
              assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body,
              it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that
              serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants
              are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.

              - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an
              invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for
              `c` a constant.

              - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved
              as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing
              `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.

              - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption
              `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum
              -> inv` as an invariant instead.

              - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving
              that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken),
              consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.

              - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr`
              an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase
              more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing
              `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).'

                We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the

                of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.


                We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop

                `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global
                assumption for now.


                Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily
                true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true
                (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since
                `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption)
                and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard
                `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g

              However, the loop guard is `y < 100000`. We cannot prove that `x >=

                Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily

                and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard

              This is because `x` is incremented by `y` (which is positive) and `y`

              Instead, we need to find an invariant that relates `x` and `y` in a
              way that is preserved by the loop body. Since `x` is incremented by
              `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`, we can consider the expression `x

              which is not allowed.


              Instead, we can consider the expression `x - y * (y + 1)`. This expression
              is not preserved by the loop body either, but we can find a related
              expression that is preserved. Since `x` is incremented by `y` and `y`
              is incremented by `1`, we can consider the expression `x - y^2 - y`.
              This expression is preserved by the loop body because `x` is incremented
              by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`.


              However, this expression still involves complex arithmetic. Instead,
              we can consider the expression `x - 2*y`. This expression is preserved
              by the loop body because `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented
              by `1`.

              message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be
              proved, we''ll show them to you as feedback. Each obligation name provides
              a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:


              - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants

              - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially

              - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be
              preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional
              invariant may be needed to complete the proof)


              In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of
              the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved
              (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions
              (`premise`).


              ## Advice


              Here is some advice for finding invariants:


              - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final
              assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body,
              it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that
              serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants
              are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.

              - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an
              invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for
              `c` a constant.

              - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved
              as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing
              `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.

              - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption
              `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum
              -> inv` as an invariant instead.

              - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving
              that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken),
              consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.

              - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr`
              an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase
              more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing
              `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).'

                We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop

                Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily

                (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since
                `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption)
                and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard

                This is because `x` is incremented by `y` (which is positive) and

                Instead, we need to find an invariant that relates `x` and `y` in

                `x - y * (y + 1) / 2`. However, this expression involves complex arithmetic,
                which is not allowed.


                Instead, we can consider the expression `x - y * (y + 1)`. This expression
                is not preserved by the loop body either, but we can find a related
                expression that is preserved. Since `x` is incremented by `y` and
                `y` is incremented by `1`, we can consider the expression `x - y^2
                - y`. This expression is preserved by the loop body because `x` is
                incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`.


                However, this expression still involves complex arithmetic. Instead,
                we can consider the expression `x - 2*y`. This expression is preserved
                by the loop body because `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented

              message and let you fix your answer. If some obligations failed to be

              a hint about the nature of a problem, which is either:


              - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants

              - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially

              - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be
              preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional
              invariant may be needed to complete the proof)


              In addition, for each obligation, I provide an annotated version of
              the program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved
              (`GOAL`) and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions
              (`premise`).


              ## Advice


              Here is some advice for finding invariants:


              - To find invariant candidates, look for formulas that imply the final
              assertion when assuming the negation of the loop guard.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to hold initially, it must be discarded.

              - If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved by the loop body,
              it might be wrong (in the sense that there exists an execution that
              serves as a counterexample), but it might also be true and other invariants
              are needed to provide additional assumptions for proving preservation.

              - Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), an
              invariant of the form `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) is likely to hold, for
              `c` a constant.

              - If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved
              as an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing
              `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.

              - If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption
              `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum
              -> inv` as an invariant instead.

              - If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving
              that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken),
              consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.

              - Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr`
              an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase
              more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing
              `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).'

                We want to prove `y <= 14` at the end of the program. Given that the
                previous invariant established an upper bound for `y` as a function
                of `x`, establishing an upper bound for `x` would be useful too.


                We can do this! Indeed, `x` is only incremented by `2` at each loop
                iteration. Thus, given the loop guard `x < 10`, we have `x < 12` at
                the end of any loop iteration. `x < 12` also holds initially because
                of assumption `x < 5` so we propose `x < 12` as an invariant.

                `n` never changes during the program, so we can treat this as a global

                Why is `g >= 1` true at the end of the program? This is not necessarily
                true initially. However, executing any loop iteration makes it true
                (`g` is assigned 4). Thus, `g >= 1 || x < n` is an invariant since
                `x < n` is true initially (treating `n > 0` as a global assumption)
                and at each iteration, either `g >= 1` is true already or the guard
                `x < n` is true, in which case the loop body executes and makes `g
                >= 1` true.


                However, `g >= 1 || x < n` is only an invariant assuming `n > 0` globally.
                But this assumption is only made AFTER the loop. Thus, we propose

                However, the loop guard is `y < 100000`. We cannot prove that `x >=

                This is because `x` is incremented by `y` (which is positive) and
                `y` is incremented by `1`.


                Instead, we need to find an invariant that relates `x` and `y` in
                a way that is preserved by the loop body. Since `x` is incremented
                by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`, we can consider the expression
                `x - y * (y + 1) / 2`. However, this expression involves complex arithmetic,
                which is not allowed.


                Instead, we can consider the expression `x - y * (y + 1)`. This expression
                is not preserved by the loop body either, but we can find a related
                expression that is preserved. Since `x` is incremented by `y` and
                `y` is incremented by `1`, we can consider the expression `x - y^2
                - y`. This expression is preserved by the loop body because `x` is
                incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`.


                However, this expression still involves complex arithmetic. Instead,
                we can consider the expression `x - 2*y`. This expression is preserved
                by the loop body because `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented
                by `1`.


                Thus, we propose `x - 2*y >= 0` as an invariant.
