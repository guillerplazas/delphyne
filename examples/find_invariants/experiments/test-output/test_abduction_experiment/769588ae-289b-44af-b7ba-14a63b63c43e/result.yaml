            content: 'Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using
              the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop
              invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved
              automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.


              We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear**
              arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication
              by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x
              + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y *
              (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT**
              propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y
              * (y + 1)`.


              I will show you an annotated program in which Why3 did not manage to
              prove a particular assertion or invariant. Your task is to suggest a
              list of new invariant candidates that may unlock the proof.


              In order to help you diagnose the problem, I added comments to the WhyML
              program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`)
              and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).
              The name of the failing proof obligation also provides a hint about
              the nature of the problem, which is either:


              - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants

              - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially

              - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be
              preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional
              invariant may be needed to complete the proof)


              Please suggest new invariant candidates. Each invariant candidate must
              be obtained by following one of the _tricks_ discussed below. A trick
              can be used multiple times. Do not suggest candidates that are already
              established invariants.


              Answer as a JSON object representing a list of `(trick_name, suggested_invariant)`
              pairs and **nothing else**.


              Examples are provided that include additional explanations for clarity.
              Do not include such explanations in your answer.



              ## Notes on Why3


              - The `any T` construct generates an arbitrary object of type `T`. In
              particular, a loop whose guard is `any bool` can run for an arbitrary
              number of times.



              ## Tricks


              Each trick is identified by a unique name. For each trick, we discuss
              *when* it is applicable and *what* the corresponding recipe is.


              ### propose_post


              If the final assertion fails to prove but appears to hold through the
              whole program, propose it as an invariant.


              ### monotone


              Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), propose
              invariant `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) for `c` some numerical constant.


              ### linear


              Whenever a linear equality or inequality between variables appears to
              hold throughout the program (e.g. `x - y >= 0`, `3*x + 2*y = 1`...),
              consider proposing it as an invariant.


              ### abduct_post


              If the final assertion fails to prove, look for a missing assumption
              that implies it when assuming all established invariants (along with
              the negation of the loop guard). Propose this assumption as a new invariant
              candidate.


              ### abduct_inv


              If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved, look for a missing
              assumption and propose it as a new invariant.


              ### strengthen_inv


              If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved, consider making it
              stronger (e.g proposing `x < y` as a replacement for `x <> y`).


              ### guard_inv


              If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption
              `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum
              -> inv` as an invariant instead.


              ### true_or_continue


              If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as
              an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing
              `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.


              ### cond_guard


              If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving
              that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken),
              consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.


              ### relax_loop_guard


              Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr`
              an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase
              more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing
              `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).'

                is always executed, and thus both `x` and `y` are incremented at each
                iteration. In turn, the conditional statement is always executed since

            content: 'Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using
              the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop
              invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved
              automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.


              We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear**
              arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication
              by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x
              + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y *
              (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT**
              propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y
              * (y + 1)`.


              I will show you an annotated program in which Why3 did not manage to
              prove a particular assertion or invariant. Your task is to suggest a
              list of new invariant candidates that may unlock the proof.


              In order to help you diagnose the problem, I added comments to the WhyML
              program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`)
              and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).
              The name of the failing proof obligation also provides a hint about
              the nature of the problem, which is either:


              - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants

              - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially

              - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be
              preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional
              invariant may be needed to complete the proof)


              Please suggest new invariant candidates. Each invariant candidate must
              be obtained by following one of the _tricks_ discussed below. A trick
              can be used multiple times. Do not suggest candidates that are already
              established invariants.


              Answer as a JSON object representing a list of `(trick_name, suggested_invariant)`
              pairs and **nothing else**.


              Examples are provided that include additional explanations for clarity.
              Do not include such explanations in your answer.



              ## Notes on Why3


              - The `any T` construct generates an arbitrary object of type `T`. In
              particular, a loop whose guard is `any bool` can run for an arbitrary
              number of times.



              ## Tricks


              Each trick is identified by a unique name. For each trick, we discuss
              *when* it is applicable and *what* the corresponding recipe is.


              ### propose_post


              If the final assertion fails to prove but appears to hold through the
              whole program, propose it as an invariant.


              ### monotone


              Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), propose
              invariant `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) for `c` some numerical constant.


              ### linear


              Whenever a linear equality or inequality between variables appears to
              hold throughout the program (e.g. `x - y >= 0`, `3*x + 2*y = 1`...),
              consider proposing it as an invariant.


              ### abduct_post


              If the final assertion fails to prove, look for a missing assumption
              that implies it when assuming all established invariants (along with
              the negation of the loop guard). Propose this assumption as a new invariant
              candidate.


              ### abduct_inv


              If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved, look for a missing
              assumption and propose it as a new invariant.


              ### strengthen_inv


              If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved, consider making it
              stronger (e.g proposing `x < y` as a replacement for `x <> y`).


              ### guard_inv


              If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption
              `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum
              -> inv` as an invariant instead.


              ### true_or_continue


              If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as
              an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing
              `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.


              ### cond_guard


              If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving
              that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken),
              consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.


              ### relax_loop_guard


              Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr`
              an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase
              more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing
              `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).'

                is always executed, and thus both `x` and `y` are incremented at each
                iteration. In turn, the conditional statement is always executed since
                `z` starts at `0` and is only decremented. This suggests adding `z

            content: 'Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using
              the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop
              invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved
              automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.


              We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear**
              arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication
              by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x
              + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y *
              (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT**
              propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y
              * (y + 1)`.


              I will show you an annotated program in which Why3 did not manage to
              prove a particular assertion or invariant. Your task is to suggest a
              list of new invariant candidates that may unlock the proof.


              In order to help you diagnose the problem, I added comments to the WhyML
              program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`)
              and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).
              The name of the failing proof obligation also provides a hint about
              the nature of the problem, which is either:


              - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants

              - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially

              - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be
              preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional
              invariant may be needed to complete the proof)


              Please suggest new invariant candidates. Each invariant candidate must
              be obtained by following one of the _tricks_ discussed below. A trick
              can be used multiple times. Do not suggest candidates that are already
              established invariants.


              Answer as a JSON object representing a list of `(trick_name, suggested_invariant)`
              pairs and **nothing else**.


              Examples are provided that include additional explanations for clarity.
              Do not include such explanations in your answer.



              ## Notes on Why3


              - The `any T` construct generates an arbitrary object of type `T`. In
              particular, a loop whose guard is `any bool` can run for an arbitrary
              number of times.



              ## Tricks


              Each trick is identified by a unique name. For each trick, we discuss
              *when* it is applicable and *what* the corresponding recipe is.


              ### propose_post


              If the final assertion fails to prove but appears to hold through the
              whole program, propose it as an invariant.


              ### monotone


              Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), propose
              invariant `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) for `c` some numerical constant.


              ### linear


              Whenever a linear equality or inequality between variables appears to
              hold throughout the program (e.g. `x - y >= 0`, `3*x + 2*y = 1`...),
              consider proposing it as an invariant.


              ### abduct_post


              If the final assertion fails to prove, look for a missing assumption
              that implies it when assuming all established invariants (along with
              the negation of the loop guard). Propose this assumption as a new invariant
              candidate.


              ### abduct_inv


              If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved, look for a missing
              assumption and propose it as a new invariant.


              ### strengthen_inv


              If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved, consider making it
              stronger (e.g proposing `x < y` as a replacement for `x <> y`).


              ### guard_inv


              If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption
              `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum
              -> inv` as an invariant instead.


              ### true_or_continue


              If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as
              an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing
              `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.


              ### cond_guard


              If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving
              that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken),
              consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.


              ### relax_loop_guard


              Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr`
              an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase
              more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing
              `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).'

                - From the shown obligation, Why3 cannot prove that `x <> y` is preserved
                by the loop body. However, this is true since the conditional statement
                is always executed, and thus both `x` and `y` are incremented at each
                iteration. In turn, the conditional statement is always executed since
                `z` starts at `0` and is only decremented. This suggests adding `z
                <= 0` as an invariant.

            content: 'Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using
              the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop
              invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved
              automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.


              We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear**
              arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication
              by constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x
              + y > 0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y *
              (y + 1) / 2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT**
              propose invariants involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y
              * (y + 1)`.


              I will show you an annotated program in which Why3 did not manage to
              prove a particular assertion or invariant. Your task is to suggest a
              list of new invariant candidates that may unlock the proof.


              In order to help you diagnose the problem, I added comments to the WhyML
              program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`)
              and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).
              The name of the failing proof obligation also provides a hint about
              the nature of the problem, which is either:


              - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants

              - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially

              - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be
              preserved by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional
              invariant may be needed to complete the proof)


              Please suggest new invariant candidates. Each invariant candidate must
              be obtained by following one of the _tricks_ discussed below. A trick
              can be used multiple times. Do not suggest candidates that are already
              established invariants.


              Answer as a JSON object representing a list of `(trick_name, suggested_invariant)`
              pairs and **nothing else**.


              Examples are provided that include additional explanations for clarity.
              Do not include such explanations in your answer.



              ## Notes on Why3


              - The `any T` construct generates an arbitrary object of type `T`. In
              particular, a loop whose guard is `any bool` can run for an arbitrary
              number of times.



              ## Tricks


              Each trick is identified by a unique name. For each trick, we discuss
              *when* it is applicable and *what* the corresponding recipe is.


              ### propose_post


              If the final assertion fails to prove but appears to hold through the
              whole program, propose it as an invariant.


              ### monotone


              Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), propose
              invariant `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) for `c` some numerical constant.


              ### linear


              Whenever a linear equality or inequality between variables appears to
              hold throughout the program (e.g. `x - y >= 0`, `3*x + 2*y = 1`...),
              consider proposing it as an invariant.


              ### abduct_post


              If the final assertion fails to prove, look for a missing assumption
              that implies it when assuming all established invariants (along with
              the negation of the loop guard). Propose this assumption as a new invariant
              candidate.


              ### abduct_inv


              If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved, look for a missing
              assumption and propose it as a new invariant.


              ### strengthen_inv


              If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved, consider making it
              stronger (e.g proposing `x < y` as a replacement for `x <> y`).


              ### guard_inv


              If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption
              `assum` that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum
              -> inv` as an invariant instead.


              ### true_or_continue


              If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as
              an invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing
              `P || loop_guard` as an invariant instead.


              ### cond_guard


              If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving
              that a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken),
              consider proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.


              ### relax_loop_guard


              Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr`
              an expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase
              more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing
              `expr < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).'

                - From the shown obligation, Why3 cannot prove that `x <> y` is preserved
                by the loop body. However, this is true since the conditional statement
                is always executed, and thus both `x` and `y` are incremented at each
                iteration. In turn, the conditional statement is always executed since
                `z` starts at `0` and is only decremented. This suggests adding `z
                <= 0` as an invariant.
