        content: 'Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the
          Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants
          in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically
          via the weakest-precondition calculus.


          We only allow invariants that feature logical combinations of **linear**
          arithmetic expressions. In particular, we only accept multiplication by
          constant numerical literals. Thus, we accept invariants such as `x + y >
          0` or `a > 0 || 2*x + y < n` but not `x * y > 0` or `x >= y * (y + 1) /
          2`. I insist, and this is **VERY IMPORTANT**, you must **NOT** propose invariants
          involving complex arithmetic such as `2 * x >= y * (y + 1)`.


          I will show you an annotated program in which Why3 did not manage to prove
          a particular assertion or invariant. Your task is to suggest a list of new
          invariant candidates that may unlock the proof.


          In order to help you diagnose the problem, I added comments to the WhyML
          program indicating what assertion or invariant failed to be proved (`GOAL`)
          and what parts of the program provide relevant assumptions (`premise`).
          The name of the failing proof obligation also provides a hint about the
          nature of the problem, which is either:


          - `assertion`: the final assertion is not implied by the invariants

          - `loop invariant init`: an invariant does not hold initially

          - `loop invariant preservation`: an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved
          by the loop body (it may not be preserved or an additional invariant may
          be needed to complete the proof)


          Please suggest new invariant candidates. Each invariant candidate must be
          obtained by following one of the _tricks_ discussed below. A trick can be
          used multiple times. Do not suggest candidates that are already established
          invariants.


          Answer as a JSON object representing a list of `(trick_name, suggested_invariant)`
          pairs and **nothing else**.


          Examples are provided that include additional explanations for clarity.
          Do not include such explanations in your answer.



          ## Notes on Why3


          - The `any T` construct generates an arbitrary object of type `T`. In particular,
          a loop whose guard is `any bool` can run for an arbitrary number of times.



          ## Tricks


          Each trick is identified by a unique name. For each trick, we discuss *when*
          it is applicable and *what* the corresponding recipe is.


          ### propose_post


          If the final assertion fails to prove but appears to hold through the whole
          program, propose it as an invariant.


          ### monotone


          Whenever a variable `x` is only incremented (resp. decremented), propose
          invariant `x >= c` (resp. `x <= c`) for `c` some numerical constant.


          ### linear


          Whenever a linear equality or inequality between variables appears to hold
          throughout the program (e.g. `x - y >= 0`, `3*x + 2*y = 1`...), consider
          proposing it as an invariant.


          ### abduct_post


          If the final assertion fails to prove, look for a missing assumption that
          implies it when assuming all established invariants (along with the negation
          of the loop guard). Propose this assumption as a new invariant candidate.


          ### abduct_inv


          If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved, look for a missing assumption
          and propose it as a new invariant.


          ### strengthen_inv


          If an invariant cannot be proved to be preserved, consider making it stronger
          (e.g proposing `x < y` as a replacement for `x <> y`).


          ### guard_inv


          If proving an invariant `inv` requires assuming a global assumption `assum`
          that is only made _after_ the loop, consider proposing `assum -> inv` as
          an invariant instead.


          ### true_or_continue


          If a property `P` always holds after the loop but cannot be proved as an
          invariant because `P` does not hold initially, consider proposing `P ||
          loop_guard` as an invariant instead.


          ### cond_guard


          If proving the preservation of an invariant candidate requires proving that
          a specific branch in the code cannot be taken (or is always taken), consider
          proposing an invariant that establishes this fact.


          ### relax_loop_guard


          Suppose the loop guard is an inequality such as `expr < c` with `expr` an
          expression and `c` a constant. Then, if quantity `expr` cannot increase
          more than a constant amount `d` at each iteration, consider proposing `expr
          < c + d` as an invariant (and similarly for <=, > and >=).'

            - From the shown obligation, Why3 cannot prove that `x <> y` is preserved
            by the loop body. However, this is true since the conditional statement
            is always executed, and thus both `x` and `y` are incremented at each
            iteration. In turn, the conditional statement is always executed since
            `z` starts at `0` and is only decremented. This suggests adding `z <=
