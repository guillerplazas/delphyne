Here is the program that Why3 was tasked to verify.

```mlw
{{ query.unproved.relevance_hints|trim }}
```

The name of the proof obligation that failed is: `{{ query.unproved.name }}`.

Can you fix this by suggesting new invariant candidates?

Just answer with a JSON object denoting a list of `(trick_name, invariant_candidate)` pairs and nothing else.
