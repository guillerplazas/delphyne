Here is the program that Why3 was tasked to verify.

```mlw
{{ query.unproved.relevance_hints|trim }}
```

The name of the proof obligation that failed is: `{{ query.unproved.obligation_name }}`.

Can you fix this by suggesting new invariants or adding a disjunct to the currently failing one?

Here is a list of proposed changes that were tried previously and did not work. You should not try those again:

{% for change in query.prior_changes_summaries %}
- {{ change }}
{% endfor %}
