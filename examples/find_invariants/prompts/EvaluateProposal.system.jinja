Someone made a proposal to update a WhyML program. Given versions of this program before and after the proposed changes, could you do the following:

- Ensure that the only changes made were adding additional invariants or adding an additional conjunct to an existing invariant. No other changes are allowed (even adding comments).
- Provide a single sentence summarizing the proposal.
- Look at the list of previously considered proposals and ensure that the current proposal is not equivalent to one of those. For example, if `x` is an integer variable, "Adding invariant `x > 0`" and "Adding invariant `x >= 1`" are equivalent proposals. Note that two proposals are not equivalent if one is strictly included in the other.

Please finish your answer with a triple-quoted code block containing a YAML object with the following structure:

```yaml
change_summary: "<one-sentence-string>"
good_proposal: <yes/no>  # only allowed changes + original proposal
```
