# Omphalos

Omphalos is a Rocq miniF2F workspace inside Delphyne.

The name comes from the omphalos, the stone at Delphi that marked the center of
the ancient world. Here it marks a smaller center: a focused place where
Delphyne meets Rocq, benchmark problems become machine-checkable proof goals,
and solver work can stay isolated from the rest of the repository.

This directory is intentionally self-contained. The benchmark files, Rocq
project metadata, and regeneration tooling live here; local build output and
temporary upstream checkouts do not belong in version control.

## What This Is

Omphalos contains a categorized copy of the
[LLM4Rocq/miniF2F-rocq](https://github.com/LLM4Rocq/miniF2F-rocq) benchmark.
It has 488 Rocq problems: 244 in `test/` and 244 in `valid/`, grouped by topic.

Each `.v` file contains:

1. A header with the problem name, split, source, informal statement, and
   informal proof.
2. The upstream Rocq imports, theorem statement, and an admitted proof body.

The goal is to provide a clean benchmark surface for experimenting with
Delphyne-guided proof search and human-in-the-loop proof development.

## Layout

```text
.
|-- _CoqProject            Rocq project file and tracked build source of truth
|-- test/                  benchmark test split, categorized by topic
|-- valid/                 miniF2F validation split, categorized by topic
`-- tools/build_layout.py  regeneration script for the benchmark layout
```

The `test/` and `valid/` splits use the same category structure:

```text
aime/
algebra/
amc/
imo/
induction/
mathd/algebra/
mathd/numbertheory/
numbertheory/
```

## Working Locally

Generate the local Rocq make metadata, then build:

```sh
rocq makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile
make -j
```

The generated `Makefile`, `Makefile.conf`, `.Makefile.d`, dependency files, and
Rocq build artifacts are ignored. They are local working files, not project
metadata for the Delphyne PR.

To work on a problem, open one of the `.v` files, replace `Admitted.` with a
proof, and type-check that file or the full project.

## Regenerating The Benchmark

Use this only when the upstream Rocq benchmark or the informal HuggingFace data
needs to be refreshed.

```sh
rm -rf _upstream
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/LLM4Rocq/miniF2F-rocq _upstream
python tools/build_layout.py
rocq makefile -f _CoqProject -o Makefile
make -j
```

`_upstream/` is a temporary local checkout. It is ignored by Git and should be
removed before preparing a PR unless you are actively regenerating the layout.

## Delphyne agentic baseline

This directory ships a small, working Delphyne-based proving agent for
miniF2F-Rocq. It is intentionally minimal: an LLM proposes a full proof
script, [pytanque](https://github.com/LLM4Rocq/pytanque) verifies it,
and the verifier's feedback (failing tactic, error, remaining goals) is
fed back so the LLM can revise — up to a configurable number of cycles.

Prerequisites:

- `rocq` available on your opam switch.
- Conda env `guille` activated (Delphyne + `pytanque` installed).
- An API key for the configured model (default: `gpt-5.4-2026-03-05`,
  overridable via `policy_args.model_name`).

Sanity run (one problem):

```sh
make test
```

Curated dev sweep (8 problems, via `delphyne.stdlib.experiments`):

```sh
make test-subset       # runs with max_workers=2; per-config outputs land in
                       # experiments/output/dev_baseline_experiment/
make replay-subset     # re-derives summaries from cached outputs (no LLM calls)
make summary           # regenerates the aggregate results_summary.csv
```

The strategy and policy live in `prove_baseline.py`; LLM prompts are in
`prompts/`. The model sees both the informal statement *and* the
informal proof sketch from each `.v` header — this is therefore a
*with-hints* baseline, intended as a starting point for further
ablations (see `bachelor_arbeit_plan.md`).

A scaffolded `experiments/full_baseline_experiment.py` is included so
scaling to the full valid split is a small mechanical change once the
dev sweep is stable.
