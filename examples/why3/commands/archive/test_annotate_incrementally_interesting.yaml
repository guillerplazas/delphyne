              To determine if the proposed invariant (`x >= y`) holds initially, we need to verify its validity at the start of the loop.

              The program initializes `x` to 1 and `y` to 0. Therefore, before entering the loop, the values are:

              - `x = 1`
              - `y = 0`

              The invariant candidate `x >= y` needs to hold at this initial state:

              - `x = 1`
              - `y = 0`

              Checking `x >= y`:
              - `1 >= 0` is true.

              Since the condition `x >= y` holds at the start of the loop, the proposed invariant is initially true.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + y >= y + 1` assuming `x >= y` and `y < 100000`. With `x` and `y` being incremented in a straightforward manner (respectively by `y` and `1`), maintaining the invariant simply requires ensuring `x` starts sufficiently large. Given `x` starts at 1 and increases by `y` while `y` starts at 0 and increments linearly, we propose an additional invariant `x >= y + 1` to maintain the needed relationship even in the increments:

              Proposed invariant:

              To determine whether the candidate invariant \( x \geq y + 1 \) holds initially, we need to check whether it is true at the start of the loop, right before the first iteration.

              Let's examine the initial values of \( x \) and \( y \):

              ```mlw
              let ref x = 1 in
              let ref y = 0 in
              ```

              At the start of the loop:
              - \( x = 1 \)
              - \( y = 0 \)

              Now, we evaluate the proposed invariant \( x \geq y + 1 \) using these values:

              \[ 1 \geq 0 + 1 \]
              \[ 1 \geq 1 \]

              This statement is true, so the candidate invariant \( x \geq y + 1 \) holds initially.

              Why3 failed to prove that after updating `x` and `y`, the invariant `x >= y + 1` is preserved. Given the invariant `x >= y + 1` before the loop step and knowing that `x` is updated to `x + y` while `y` is updated to `y + 1`, we need to ensure that `(x + y) >= (y + 1 + 1)` holds.

              From the feedback, we know:

              - `x >= y + 1`
              - `x >= y`
              - `y < 100000`

              This suggests that `x` grows at least as fast as `y + 1`, but it's not sufficient to guarantee `x + y >= y + 2`.

              To find a suitable invariant, we should consider the growth relationship between `x` and `y`. Given `x >= y + 1`, incrementing `y` means that iterating through the loop `N` times will result in `y` being incremented by 1 each time. Thus, a new invariant candidate could be focused on the differences in their growth rates. The simplest possible invariant to make this true is an explicit relationship between `x` and the iteration steps of the loop.

              Based on the formula, `x`, grows faster than `y + 2`, suggesting the proper invariant may increase by each loop iteration. Considering this, a plausible invariant extension to help proofs is:

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              x >= y + 2
              ```

              Given that each loop increase effectively translates `x = x + y` so, after `N` iterations, the difference between `x` and `y+2` should suffice.

              Hence the invariant added provides the required increment adjustment to maintain the structural growth rate.

              The invariant `x >= 2*y` will ensure preservation as `x + y - (y + 2)` will yield `x - 2*y + 1 >= 0`.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + y >= y + 2` assuming `x >= y + 1`, `x >= y`, and `y < 100000`. To satisfy this, we can instead express the invariant ensuring that the updated `x + y` remains at least two units ahead of `y + 1`, thereby reinforcing that the gap between `x` and `y` grows or at least maintains a minimum distance.

              Proposed invariant:

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + y >= y + 2` assuming `x >= y + 1` and `x >= y`. To maintain this property, we need an invariant that directly represents the result of the transformation `x <- x + y` and `y <- y + 1`.

              Given that `x` is incremented by `y` in each iteration, and `y` is incremented by 1, the incremental sum is reflected linearly. Therefore, a possible useful invariant is:

              ```
              x >= y * (y + 1) / 2
              ```

              However, since we are restricted to linear invariants, we must adopt a simpler approach that is directly related to the transformation steps. We need to ensure that the incremental product always satisfies the process' outcome, without engaging multiplications or higher-order relationships.

              Instead, focus on the relationship between `x`, `y`, and how `x` evolves. Another simpler, linear invariant correlating with the variables could be noticed by observing that `x` should always be at least 1 plus the arithmetic addition of iterative increments.

              Given the constraints:

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              x >= y + 1

              To determine whether the proposed invariant `x >= y + 1` holds initially, we need to evaluate its truth when the program starts the loop for the first time.

              Initially, the program sets:
              - `x` to 1
              - `y` to 0

              Before the loop begins, we check the invariant candidate `x >= y + 1`:
              - `x` is 1
              - `y + 1` is 0 + 1 which equals 1

              Therefore, initially:
              - `1 >= 1` is true

              So, the invariant `x >= y + 1` holds initially.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x >= y` after the loop, assuming `y >= 100000`. Even if `x >= y` was an invariant, it might not be strong enough to carry the proof through.

              To figure out a correct invariant, let's look at how `x` and `y` change within the loop:
              - `x` starts at 1 and is incremented by `y` with each iteration.
              - `y` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 with each iteration.

              Given these updates, it's evident that over time, `x` accumulates significantly larger values than `y` just due to repeated additions of `y` to itself.

              Thus, an invariant that captures the relative growth of `x` with respect to `y` is needed. Since `x` accumulates all previous values of `y`, `x` should always be at least `y * (y + 1) / 2 + 1`. However, since multiplication is forbidden, an invariant that bounds `x` in a simpler way might be helpful:

              We can note that at each step, `x` increases more than `y` increases.

              We could propose the invariant that strengthens the relationship between `x` and `y`:

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              x > y
              ```

              This captures the general trend that `x` is not only greater than or equal to `y`, but strictly grows much faster due to the nature of the addition, ensuring that the assertion `x >= y` holds true in the end.

              To determine whether the proposed invariant `x > y` holds initially in the given program, let's analyze the values of `x` and `y` at the start of the loop.

              Initial assignments before the loop:
              ```mlw
              let ref x = 1 in         // x is initially 1
              let ref y = 0 in         // y is initially 0
              ```

              These are the values of `x` and `y` just before the loop starts.

              Now, let's check if the invariant `x > y` holds with these initial values:
              ```mlw
              x = 1
              y = 0
              ```
              Substituting these values into the invariant:
              ```mlw
              1 > 0   // This is true
              ```

              Since the invariant `x > y` holds with the initial values of `x` and `y`, the proposed invariant `x > y` holds initially.

              \[
              x + y > y + 1 \implies x > 1
              \]

              Therefore, maintaining `x >= 1` should help to prove the invariant preservation and align with the program's flow.

              => x + y > y + 1

              ```

              `x > 1` appears to hold throughout the program. Thus, adding it as an invariant should help in proving the assertion:

              This suggests that placing an invariant that `x > y + 1` instead of `x > y` will make the proof hold. To avoid proposing the initial loop invariant (which was `x > y`), let's gradually extend it with the relationship observed.

              Proposed invariant:

                 \[
                 x > 1
                 \]

              Now, we see that `x > 1` needs to hold to preserve the invariant. Hence, an appropriate invariant to add would be that `x` is always greater than 1. Indeed, `x` starts at 1, and since `x` is always incremented by at least `y`, which starts from 0 and grows arbitrarily, this should hold true throughout the loop.

              Proposed invariant:

              Given the available assumptions, we need to show that incrementing `y` by 1 and then adding it to `x` still maintains the invariant. One way to assist in proving the correctness is to assert that the increment of `x` maintains a specific relationship with `y`.

              We can see from the loop `x <- x + y` and `y <- y + 1` that `x` is steadily increasing by the current value of `y`. Therefore, a reasonable supplementary invariant is that `x` is always greater than or equal to `y * (y + 1) / 2`, which would grow as the sum of the first `y` natural numbers. However, for simplicity and linear constraints, we can go for a simpler invariant that helps maintain the intended relationship.

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              x >= y + 1

              3. **Invariant check before the first iteration**:
                 - Before the loop starts, \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 0 \).
                 - The proposed invariant is \( x \geq 1 \).

              Given these steps, at the very beginning, \( x \) is assigned the value \( 1 \). Therefore,

              \[ x \geq 1 \text{ is } 1 \geq 1 \]

              This statement is true initially before the loop begins.

              Thus, the proposed invariant \( x \geq 1 \) holds initially.

              Why3 failed to prove that `(x + y) >= 1` assuming `x >= 1` and `x >= y`. Given `x >= y`, a plausible missing invariant is that `y >= 0`, which indicates that `y` is always non-negative.

              Proposed invariant:

              To determine whether the proposed invariant `y >= 0` holds initially, we need to examine the state of the variables at the beginning of the loop.

              Here's the initial state before the loop starts:
              - `x` is initialized to `1`
              - `y` is initialized to `0`

              Before the loop executes its first iteration, the invariant must hold. We analyze the initial value of `y` to see if it satisfies `y >= 0`.

              Given the initialization:
              - \( y = 0 \)

              Therefore:
              - \( y \geq 0 \)

              This shows that the proposed invariant `y >= 0` holds initially as \( 0 \geq 0 \) is true.

              The invariant is valid initially.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + 1 <> y` assuming `x <> y`, `x < 10` and `z - 1 >= 0`. Assumption `z - 1 >= 0` does not appear to ever hold in the program since `z` starts at 0 and is then only decremented. Thus, we propose its negation as an invariant, which is `z - 1 < 0` and which simplifies to `z < 1`.

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              z < 1
              ```

              However, Why3 did not succeed in proving some assertions and/or invariants. Thus, you must suggest a new loop invariant to unlock the proof.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + 1 <> y` assuming `x <> y`, `x < 10` and `z - 1 >= 0`. Assumption `z - 1 >= 0` does not appear to ever hold in the program since `z` starts at 0 and is then only decremented. Thus, we propose its negation as an invariant, which is `z - 1 < 0` and which simplifies to `z < 1`.

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              z < 1

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + 1 <> y` assuming `x <> y`, `x < 10` and `z - 1 >= 0`. Assumption `z - 1 >= 0` does not appear to ever hold in the program since `z` starts at 0 and is then only decremented. Thus, we propose its negation as an invariant, which is `z - 1 < 0` and which simplifies to `z < 1`.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + 1 <> y` assuming `x <> y`, `x < 10` and `z - 1 >= 0`. Assumption `z - 1 >= 0` does not appear to ever hold in the program since `z` starts at 0 and is then only decremented. Thus, we propose its negation as an invariant, which is `z - 1 < 0` and which simplifies to `z < 1`.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

                while x < 10 do
                  x <- x + 1;
                  z <- z - 1;
                  if z < 0 then y <- y + 1
                done;
                assert { x <> y }

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + 1 <> y` assuming `x <> y`, `x < 10` and `z - 1 >= 0`. Assumption `z - 1 >= 0` does not appear to ever hold in the program since `z` starts at 0 and is then only decremented. Thus, we propose its negation as an invariant, which is `z - 1 < 0` and which simplifies to `z < 1`.

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              z < 1
