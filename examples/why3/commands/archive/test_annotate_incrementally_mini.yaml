              Why3 failed to prove that `x >= y` assuming `y >= 100000`. In order to show that `x` is always at least as large as `y`, we could establish that `x` grows at least as fast as `y` increases during the loop.

              Since `x` starts at 1 and each loop iteration adds `y` to `x`, we observe that `x` changes in a way that is dependent on `y`. Therefore, a useful invariant could relate `x` to the sum of all integers from 0 to `y`, which can help ensure that `x >= y`.

              The sum of the first `y` integers is `y * (y - 1) / 2`. Therefore, we can conclude that `x` should be at least as large as this sum, but since `y` strictly increments, we can propose a simpler invariant which states that `x` is at least as large as the cumulative total of the integers added up at least once (which can be simplified to `x >= y * (y - 1) / 2`).

              However, to keep the invariant simple and linear, we note that `x` will always be increasing (it starts from 1), thus the invariant `x >= y * (y / 2)` or just `x > y` might be unnecessary when we want simplicity.

              A simple resulting invariant would then be:
              ```
              x >= y
              ```
              but since that was already assumed insufficiently, we refine our search for something less direct.

              Consider instead a direct linear relationship after a number of iterations.

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              x >= (y * (y + 1) / 2)
              ```

              However, realizing that such a complex expression isn't linear may lead us to simply focus on `x >= y` itself being modified slightly.

              After clarifying needs, we phrase:

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              x >= 0
              ```

              (Potentially considering `x >= y` translates into other comparative checks against the conditional values thus being naive.)

              In a reopening for cleared reasonableness and direct relevance— we state clearly _growth_ of x via constructive counter, leading through conditions states leading towards anticipated values, focusing on boundaries that leads to— thus:

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              y < 100001
              ```
              This allowing for `y <= 100000...` More fundamentally deriving bounds.

              To evaluate whether the proposed loop invariant `y < 100001` holds initially, we need to consider the state of the variables before entering the loop.

              At the start of the `main` function:
              - `x` is initialized to `1`.
              - `y` is initialized to `0`.

              Now, we check the condition of the invariant:
              - Before the loop starts, `y` is `0`.
              - The invariant states that `y < 100001`.

              Since `0 < 100001` is true, the invariant holds initially.

              Therefore, the proposed invariant `y < 100001` is valid at the start of the loop.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x >= y` assuming `y < 100001` and that `y >= 100000` after the last iteration of the loop. To help establish the relationship between `x` and `y` throughout the loop, we can propose that `x` is always greater than or equal to the sum of all integers from 0 up to `y`.

              Since `y` starts at 0 and is incremented, while `x` increments by `y` in each iteration, we can express this as follows:

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              x >= (y * (y - 1)) / 2 + 1  // Sum of all integers from 0 to y-1 plus 1
              ```

              This captures the idea that `x` grows to encompass the accumulated contributions of all `y` values up to its current value.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x >= y` assuming `y < 100001`. In order to establish a more precise relation between `x` and `y` during the loop, we can consider keeping track of the values added to `x`. Since `x` starts at 1 and increases by `y` during each iteration while `y` increments, it may help to establish a relation based on the initial value of `x` and subsequent additions.

              The simplest linear relation we can propose is that `x` is always greater than or equal to the sum of all elements of `y` that were added so far plus the initial value of `x`. As `y` starts at 0, we can use a more straightforward form based on the number of iterations. After `y` iterations, the sum of the first `y` natural numbers is `y * (y + 1) / 2`, and since `x` starts at 1, we can state that during the loop:

              ```
              x >= 1 + (y * (y - 1) / 2)
              ```

              However, to keep it linear and simple, we can use the fact that `y` will be incremented at each step.

              Thus, a plausible invariant that can be utilized is:

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              x >= y * (y + 1) / 2
              ```

              This invariant will help establish the necessary relationship throughout the loop iterations, aligning `x` with the progress of `y`.

              Why3 failed to prove the goal that `x >= y` given the assumptions that `y < 100001` and `y >= 100000`. To establish that `x` will always be at least `y`, we could consider expressing a relationship between the increments of `x` and `y`. Since `x` starts at `1` and increments by `y` during each iteration while `y` simply increments by `1`, we need to show that `x` accumulates enough value over the increments.

              A plausible invariant is to relate the value of `x` to the number of increments made to `y`. Specifically, we can use the fact that `y` starts at `0` and at the `k`-th iteration, `y` will be `k`. At that point, `x` can be expressed with the knowledge that it accumulates all previous values of `y`.

              In particular, we can propose the invariant that `x` is sufficiently larger than the sum of the first `y` integers up to its maximum value. Therefore, an important relationship to maintain in addition to the previous `y < 100001` is that:

              ```
              x >= (y * (y - 1)) / 2 + 1
              ```

              However, to simplify our proposal, we can put it in terms of `y`, observing that if we state that `x` is always increasing and starting from `1`, we can also directly relate it to just keeping track of whether `x` is at least `y`. Thus, simplifying:

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              x >= y

              To determine whether the proposed invariant \( x \geq y \) holds initially, we need to evaluate the values of \( x \) and \( y \) before entering the loop.

              - \( x = 1 \)
              - \( y = 0 \)

              Thus, we evaluate the proposed invariant:

                 - Current values: \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 0 \).
                 - Checking the condition: \( 1 \geq 0 \) is true.

              Since the invariant \( x \geq y \) holds true when the loop is first entered (given the initial values of \( x \) and \( y \)), we conclude that the candidate invariant is indeed satisfied at the start of the loop.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + y >= y + 1`, given that `x >= y` and `y < 100001`. Rearranging the goal, we see that if we add `y` to both sides of `x >= y` we get `x + y >= y + y`, which means we need to establish that `x + y` is at least equal to `y + 1`. Thus, after a bit of thought, we can propose that `x` is at least `y + 1`, which would satisfy the loop invariant.

              To establish whether the proposed invariant \( x \geq y + 1 \) holds initially, we need to evaluate it in the context of the initial values assigned to \( x \) and \( y \):

              1. The program initializes \( x \) to 1 and \( y \) to 0.
              2. The proposed invariant states that \( x \) should be at least \( y + 1 \) at the start of each loop iteration.

              Now let's check the initial condition before entering the loop:
              - At initialization, \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 0 \).
              - Evaluate the proposed invariant:
                - Substitute the values:
                - \( 1 \geq 0 + 1 \) simplifies to \( 1 \geq 1 \).

              Since the inequality \( 1 \geq 1 \) is true, the proposed invariant \( x \geq y + 1 \) holds initially.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x >= y` assuming `y >= 100000`. An additional invariant that relates `x` and `y` as the loop executes would help. Since `x` accumulates the values of `y` in each iteration, it can be proposed that `x` is always at least the sum of the first `y` integers.

              The relationship can be expressed using the formula for the sum of the first `n` integers, which is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \). However, since we are restricted to linear invariants, we can summarize this as `x >= (y * (y - 1)) / 2`, but that is not feasible for a linear invariant.

              Instead, we can simplify our proposal to capture that `x` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to the number of iterations, represented simply by `x >= y`.

              To determine whether the proposed invariant \(x \geq y + 1\) holds initially, we need to evaluate its truth at the start of the loop.

              - \(y = 0\)

              - The right side of the invariant is \(y + 1\), which equals \(0 + 1 = 1\).

              We check whether the invariant holds:

              \[
              x \geq y + 1 \iff 1 \geq 1
              \]

              This is true, so the invariant \(x \geq y + 1\) holds initially.

              However, for loop invariants, they must typically hold throughout the loop iterations, and there has to be a valid scope of reasoning to prove it. The crux of the matter is whether the invariant remains valid under all conditions proposed by the loop's operations—this may require further context. However, focusing purely on the initial invocation:
              - Since the proposed invariant holds at the start of the while loop, we can assign a high confidence score based on this initial condition.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + y >= (y + 1 + 1)`, which simplifies to `x + y >= (y + 2)`. Given the existing loop invariants `x >= (y + 1)` and `x >= y`, we need an invariant that implies this condition after the statement `x <- x + y;`.

              The most straightforward linear relation we can propose as a new invariant is `x >= 2`. This should help maintain the required condition once `y` is incremented.

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              x >= 2
              ```

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + y >= y + 2` assuming `x >= y + 1` and `x >= y`. We can derive a linear invariant drawing from these existing conditions by focusing on the relationship between `x` and `y`. We know that after each iteration, `x` is increased by `y` and we must ensure that `x` grows sufficiently in relation to `y`.

              We can propose the invariant `x >= y + 2`, as this helps to establish a clear margin between `x` and the value of `y + 1`, which is required in the failing proof obligation.

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              x >= y + 2

              Why3 failed to prove that `x >= y` while assuming `y < 100001` and `y >= 100000`. Since `y` starts at `0` and increments in the loop, we can derive a linear relationship between `x` and `y`.

              In particular, we know that `x` is being accumulated as `x = 1 + (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (y - 1))` during each iteration of the loop, which means we can track the cumulative sum of integers that have been added to `x`.

              At any given iteration, after incrementing `y`, we can state that `x` is the sum of all integers from `0` to `y - 1`, which can be represented using a linear invariant: `x = (y * (y - 1)) / 2 + 1`.

              However, to derive a simpler relation that can be proven at each iteration, we can propose an invariant based on the cumulative effect the loop has had on `y`.

              The invariant `x >= (y * (y - 1)) / 2` guarantees that the sum of all previous `y` values has been accounted for in `x`, and since this would inherently maintain the relationship needed for the assertion, it serves as a strong candidate for modification.

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              x >= y * (y - 1) / 2

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + y >= y + 1` assuming `x >= y` and `y < 100001`. To make the proof work, we can derive a simpler invariant that directly addresses the relationship between `x` and `y`.

              Notably, since `y` is always incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, we can state that `x` will always be at least 1 more than `y` after the first loop iteration, and therefore we can propose the invariant that `x > y`.

              Proposed invariant:

              To determine whether the proposed invariant \( x > y \) holds initially for the given WhyML program, we need to analyze the initial values of \( x \) and \( y \) before the loop begins.

              Initially, the program sets:

              - \( x = 1 \)
              - \( y = 0 \)

              Now we check the proposed invariant:

              1. \( x > y \) means we need to verify if \( 1 > 0 \).
              2. This condition holds true since \( 1 \) is indeed greater than \( 0 \).

              Therefore, the invariant \( x > y \) is valid at the start of the loop as \( x \) and \( y \) are initialized to \( 1 \) and \( 0 \) respectively.

              Considering these findings, we can conclude that the proposed invariant holds initially.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + y >= y + 1`, with the available assumptions showing that `x >= y` and `y < 100000`. Rewriting the goal, we can rearrange it to `x >= 1`, since `y` is guaranteed to be less than 100000 (hence, `y + 1` will always be greater than `y`).

              To ensure the proof obligation is satisfied, we can add the invariant `x >= 1` as `x` starts from 1 and only increases throughout the loop.

              Proposed invariant:

              x >= 1

              To verify whether the invariant candidate `x >= 1` holds initially for the provided program, we need to examine the initial values of `x` and `y` before entering the loop.

              At the start of the program:
              - `x` is initialized to `1`
              - `y` is initialized to `0`

              Now let's check the proposed invariant:
              - The invariant states that `x >= 1`. Since `x` is initialized to `1`, the condition `1 >= 1` holds true.

              Since the invariant must hold before the first iteration of the loop and it is satisfied initially, the proposed invariant `x >= 1` holds at the beginning of the loop.

              Therefore, the proposed invariant is indeed valid at the initial state of the program.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + y >= 1`, given that `x >= 1` and `x >= y` hold as loop invariants. The current invariants do not sufficiently relate `x` and `y` together to prove the goal. Since `y` is always less than 100,000 but starts at 0 and increases while `x` increases faster, we can propose that `x` is always greater than or equal to `y`, and since `y` starts at 0, an invariant that relates these two through their minimum values is feasible.

              A suitable invariant to add is:
              ```
              y >= 0
              ```
              This captures that `y` being non-negative supports the assertion needed.

              To analyze whether the proposed loop invariant `y >= 0` holds initially, we need to check the value of `y` at the start of the loop.

              At the beginning of the `main` function, `y` is initialized to `0`:

              ```mlw
              let ref y = 0 in
              ```

              Since `y` is initialized to `0`, and the loop condition is `while y < 100000 do`, it implies that before the first iteration of the loop, `y` is indeed equal to `0`.

              Now we need to check if `y >= 0` holds. For the initial value of `y`, which is `0`, the condition `y >= 0` is satisfied:

              - At the start of the loop, `y = 0`, so the invariant `y >= 0` holds true.

              Since the proposed invariant `y >= 0` holds at the start of the loop, we can conclude that the invariant does hold initially.

Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + 1 <> y` assuming `x <> y`, `x < 10` and `z - 1 >= 0`. Assumption `z - 1 >= 0` does not appear to ever hold in the program since `z` starts at 0 and is then only decremented. Thus, we propose its negation as an invariant, which is `z - 1 < 0` and which simplifies to `z < 1`.

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              z < 1
              ```

              However, Why3 did not succeed in proving some assertions and/or invariants. Thus, you must suggest a new loop invariant to unlock the proof.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + 1 <> y` assuming `x <> y`, `x < 10` and `z - 1 >= 0`. Assumption `z - 1 >= 0` does not appear to ever hold in the program since `z` starts at 0 and is then only decremented. Thus, we propose its negation as an invariant, which is `z - 1 < 0` and which simplifies to `z < 1`.

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              z < 1

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + 1 <> y` assuming `x <> y`, `x < 10` and `z - 1 >= 0`. Assumption `z - 1 >= 0` does not appear to ever hold in the program since `z` starts at 0 and is then only decremented. Thus, we propose its negation as an invariant, which is `z - 1 < 0` and which simplifies to `z < 1`.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x <> y` assuming `x >= 10`. Formula `x <> y` appears to hold throughout the program so we propose it as an invariant.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + 1 <> y` assuming `x <> y`, `x < 10` and `z - 1 >= 0`. Assumption `z - 1 >= 0` does not appear to ever hold in the program since `z` starts at 0 and is then only decremented. Thus, we propose its negation as an invariant, which is `z - 1 < 0` and which simplifies to `z < 1`.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.
