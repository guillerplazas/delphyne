              Why3 failed to prove that `x >= y` at the end of the loop, assuming `y >= 100000`. The invariant needs to uphold throughout the loop to make this true. Given that `x` starts at 1 and `y` starts at 0, and `x` is being incremented by `y` in each iteration, while `y` is incremented by 1, we can infer that `x` will always be greater than or equal to `y`.

              Thus, let's propose `x >= y` as an invariant.

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              x >= y

              Let's analyze the provided program and the invariant candidate.

              The program starts with `x = 1` and `y = 0`. The loop condition is `y < 100000`.

              Here's the loop body:
              1. `x <- x + y`
              2. `y <- y + 1`

              The invariant candidate is `x >= y`.

              To check if the invariant holds initially, we examine the values of `x` and `y` before the loop starts.

              Initial values:
              - `x = 1`
              - `y = 0`

              Before the loop begins, the invariant `x >= y` translates to:
              - `1 >= 0`, which is true.

              Thus, the invariant `x >= y` holds initially.

              Why3 failed to prove that `(x + y) >= (y + 1)` assuming `x >= y` and `y < 100000`. We can simplify the failing goal:

              ```

              To determine if the proposed invariant \( x \ge 1 \) holds initially, we need to analyze the state of the variables when entering the loop for the first time. Let's go step by step:

              1. **Initialization**:
                  - The variable `x` is initialized to 1.
                  - The variable `y` is initialized to 0.

              2. **Invariant Check**:
                  - Before the first iteration of the loop, the loop invariant must hold. This means we need to check if \( x \ge 1 \) holds given the initial values of `x` and `y`.

              From the initialization:
              - \( x = 1 \)
              - \( y = 0 \)

              Considering the invariant candidate \( x \ge 1 \):
              - With \( x = 1 \), the invariant \( x \ge 1 \) holds true initially.

              This means the invariant candidate \( x \ge 1 \) is indeed valid initially, because the initial value of `x` is 1, which satisfies the condition \( x \ge 1 \).

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + y >= 1` assuming `x >= 1`, `x >= y` and `y < 100000`. Given that `x >= 1` and `x >= y`, adding the current `y` to `x` will maintain `x + y >= 1` naturally. However, it seems we need to assert an overall sum invariant involving `x` and `y` which guarantees the formula holds. Since `x` starts at `1` and `y` at `0`, their sum starts at `1`.

              Proposed invariant:

              To verify whether the proposed invariant `x + y >= 1` holds initially, we need to check its validity before entering the loop. Let's analyze the initialization of variables `x` and `y` before the loop:

              ```

              Here, `x` is initialized to `1` and `y` is initialized to `0`.

              We now evaluate the invariant before entering the loop:

              ```
              x + y = 1 + 0 = 1
              ```

              Since `1 >= 1`, the invariant `x + y >= 1` holds true upon initialization.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x >= y` assuming `y >= 100000`. We need to find a simpler invariant that can help in proving the assertion `x >= y`. Observing the loop, we see that `x` is incremented by `y` every iteration. Therefore, if `x` and `y` start at 1 and 0 respectively, then `x` will always be at least `y + 1`.

              Thus, a plausible loop invariant is:

              x >= y + 1

              To determine if the proposed invariant `x >= y + 1` holds initially, let's examine the initial values of `x` and `y` before the loop begins.

              Initially, we have:
              - `x = 1`
              - `y = 0`

              To check whether the invariant `x >= y + 1` holds at this initial state:

              1. Substitute the initial values into the invariant:
                 ```
                 x = 1
                 y = 0
                 ```

              2. Evaluate the invariant:
                 ```
                 1 >= 0 + 1
                 1 >= 1
                 ```

              The invariant `x >= y + 1` is satisfied because `1` is indeed greater than or equal to `1`.

              Thus, the proposed invariant holds initially.

              The violation occurs when trying to prove `(x + y) >= (y + 2)` under the assumption that `x >= y + 1`. This discrepancy suggests that the invariant relating `x`, `y`, and their updates was not strong enough to maintain through the loop.

              One stronger invariant could be to assert that `x` is always at least twice `y` which helps maintain the desired property after each step of the loop.

              To determine whether the candidate invariant \( x \geq y + 1 \) holds initially for the given program, we need to examine the initialization of the variables and the condition of the loop.

              Here is the annotated program:
              ```mlw
              use int.Int

              let main () diverges =
                let ref x = 1 in
                let ref y = 0 in
                while y < 100000 do
                  invariant { x >= y + 1 }
                  x <- x + y;
                  y <- y + 1
                done;
                assert { x >= y }
              ```

              At the start of the loop, the values of \( x \) and \( y \) are as follows:
              - \( x \) is initialized to 1
              - \( y \) is initialized to 0

              The condition to enter the loop is \( y < 100000 \), which is true initially.

              Now, let's check the candidate invariant \( x \geq y + 1 \) at the start of the loop:

              1. Initially, \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 0 \).
              2. Substituting the initial values into the invariant candidate:
                 - \( x \geq y + 1 \)
                 - \( 1 \geq 0 + 1 \)
                 - \( 1 \geq 1 \)

              This inequality \( 1 \geq 1 \) holds true. Hence, the invariant \( x \geq y + 1 \) is satisfied at the beginning of the loop.

              Why3 failed to prove that `(x + y) >= ((y + 1) + 1)` assuming `x >= y + 1`, `x >= y`, and `y < 100000`. This verification condition states that after an iteration of the loop, the invariant `x >= y + 1` must still hold. Given that `x` and `y` both increase during the loop, a plausible linear invariant that respects their growth and maintains the necessary properties would involve their relationships at each step.

              We need to add an invariant that ensures not just `x >= y + 1` and `x >= y`, but also reflects the accumulation of `x` due to `y`.

              An effective approach is to note that after each addition, `x` is at least as large as the sum of the initial values it had plus the number of steps multiplied by `y`. We can set a invariant tracking such patterns, and an invariant such as `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2 + 1` (sum of an arithmetic series) directly isn't linear, but such pattern could be enforced by something trackable close enough:

              A simpler approach then would be to observe that given `x` always accumulating after each step due to added `y`, the property `x >= 0`:
              And strengthen invariant on linear sense with progressive intake:

              Why3 failed to prove that `(x + y) >= 1` assuming `x >= 1`, `x >= y`, and `y < 100000`. From these assumptions, we recognize that `x >= y` establishes a connection between the values of `x` and `y`, but it is not enough to establish the required relationship of `(x + y) >= 1`.

              Analyzing the initial setup, `x` is initialized to `1`, and `y` is initialized to `0`. Since `x` is always increasing and `x >= y`, we can deduce the invariant that `x > y`.

              By adding the invariant `x > y`, we ensure that `(x + y) >= 1` will hold at each iteration of the loop.

              Given that `x` starts at 1 and `y` starts at 0 and both `x` and `y` increase in each iteration, a useful invariant would be one that captures the relationship between `x` and `y` in a way that helps us assert that their sum is always greater than or equal to 1.

              ```
              x + y >= 1
              ```

              However, since this has been proposed already, let's look instead at ensuring a property that involves directly controlling how `y` evolves relative to `x`. Given that `x` is incremented by `y` in each iteration and it starts at `1`, the value of `x` should always be greater than or equal to `1 + y`. This is another relationship to maintain as an invariant:

Since `x` starts at 1 and is incremented by `y` inside the loop, and `y` starts at 0 and is incremented each iteration, it will be helpful to state that `x + y >= 1` holds throughout the loop. However, since we have been asked not to use this invariant, we can propose an invariant that can support this relationship. Specifically, we can ensure that `x` grows sufficiently by ensuring `x >= y * (y + 1) / 2 + 1` because the sum of the first `y` natural numbers is `y * (y + 1) / 2`.

              Proposed invariant:

              Why3 failed to prove that `(x + y) >= 1` assuming `x >= 1`, `x >= y`, and `y < 100000`. From these assumptions, it seems the program needs an invariant that reflects how both `x` and `y` grow during each loop iteration: while `x` accumulates the value of `y`, `y` is incremented by 1 starting from 0. This suggests that the invariant `x >= y` alone may not fully capture the necessary relationship between `x` and `y` for this proof.

              The additional invariant that can help unlock the proof is the initial value of `x`, which stays non-negative and grows such that `x >= 1` and `x >= y` hold together. To capture this relationship in the loop, consider that each step adds at least 1 to `x` (since `y` starts from 0).

              We can prove that `x >= (y + 1)` as an invariant, leveraging the fact that `x` starts at 1 and `y` starts at 0 and continually increments by 1, ensuring `x` will always be ahead.

              Given the assumptions, `x` and `y` must increment together in a way that maintains `x + y` non-negative and at least 1. Since initially `x = 1` and `y = 0`, the sum `x + y` starts as 1. As both `x` and `y` only increase, we can propose the invariant:

              Why3 failed to prove that `x >= y` assuming `y >= 100000`. We can infer that the issue lies in ensuring `x` grows fast enough to always be at least as large as `y`. Adding a linear invariant that tracks `x`'s growth relative to `y` can help.

              Notice that initially, `x = 1` and `y = 0`, and during each iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by the current value of `y`. Given that `y` increases by 1 each iteration, the value of `x` would be at least the sum of an arithmetic series of `y`.

              To capture the relationship between `x` and `y` dynamically, we need to ensure that `x` is always at least the sum of integers from 1 to `y-1`, which can be precisely bounded by using the minimum initial difference `x - y` throughout the loop.

              Thus, the following invariant should help capture this relationship consistently:

              ```whyml
              x >= y * (y - 1) / 2 + 1
              ```

              However, since we need a strictly linear invariant, observing the bounds linearly:

              Initial values yield `x >= 1 + y`. Extending this, suitably generalized with appropriate safe bounds as a linear expression can be:

              ```whyml
              x >= y
              ```

              is a trivial available proposed invariant, which leaves us one from refined bounds uniquely:

              To determine whether the proposed invariant `x >= y + 1` holds initially, we need to check if it is satisfied at the start of the loop.

                assert { x >= y }
              ```

              Before entering the loop for the first time:
              - `x` is initially set to `1`.
              - `y` is initially set to `0`.

              Plugging these initial values into the invariant:
              - We need to check if `1 >= 0 + 1`.

              This simplifies to:
              - `1 >= 1`, which is true.

              Therefore, the proposed invariant `x >= y + 1` does indeed hold initially.

              2. **Check if the Invariant Holds Initially:**
                 - Before entering the loop for the first iteration, `y = 0`.
                 - The invariant `y >= 0` evaluates to `0 >= 0`, which is `True`.

              Therefore, the proposed invariant `y >= 0` holds initially.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + 1 <> y` assuming `x <> y`, `x < 10` and `z - 1 >= 0`. Assumption `z - 1 >= 0` does not appear to ever hold in the program since `z` starts at 0 and is then only decremented. Thus, we propose its negation as an invariant, which is `z - 1 < 0` and which simplifies to `z < 1`.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + 1 <> y` assuming `x <> y`, `x < 10` and `z - 1 >= 0`. Assumption `z - 1 >= 0` does not appear to ever hold in the program since `z` starts at 0 and is then only decremented. Thus, we propose its negation as an invariant, which is `z - 1 < 0` and which simplifies to `z < 1`.

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              z < 1

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + 1 <> y` assuming `x <> y`, `x < 10` and `z - 1 >= 0`. Assumption `z - 1 >= 0` does not appear to ever hold in the program since `z` starts at 0 and is then only decremented. Thus, we propose its negation as an invariant, which is `z - 1 < 0` and which simplifies to `z < 1`.

              Proposed invariant:

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + 1 <> y` assuming `x <> y`, `x < 10` and `z - 1 >= 0`. Assumption `z - 1 >= 0` does not appear to ever hold in the program since `z` starts at 0 and is then only decremented. Thus, we propose its negation as an invariant, which is `z - 1 < 0` and which simplifies to `z < 1`.

              Proposed invariant:

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + 1 <> y` assuming `x <> y`, `x < 10` and `z - 1 >= 0`. Assumption `z - 1 >= 0` does not appear to ever hold in the program since `z` starts at 0 and is then only decremented. Thus, we propose its negation as an invariant, which is `z - 1 < 0` and which simplifies to `z < 1`.

              Proposed invariant:
              ```
              z < 1

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + 1 <> y` assuming `x <> y`, `x < 10` and `z - 1 >= 0`. Assumption `z - 1 >= 0` does not appear to ever hold in the program since `z` starts at 0 and is then only decremented. Thus, we propose its negation as an invariant, which is `z - 1 < 0` and which simplifies to `z < 1`.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + 1 <> y` assuming `x <> y`, `x < 10` and `z - 1 >= 0`. Assumption `z - 1 >= 0` does not appear to ever hold in the program since `z` starts at 0 and is then only decremented. Thus, we propose its negation as an invariant, which is `z - 1 < 0` and which simplifies to `z < 1`.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + 1 <> y` assuming `x <> y`, `x < 10` and `z - 1 >= 0`. Assumption `z - 1 >= 0` does not appear to ever hold in the program since `z` starts at 0 and is then only decremented.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + 1 <> y` assuming `x <> y`, `x < 10` and `z - 1 >= 0`. Assumption `z - 1 >= 0` does not appear to ever hold in the program since `z` starts at 0 and is then only decremented.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Your goal is to prove the correctness of WhyML programs using the Why3 theorem prover. To do so, you must annotate programs with loop invariants in such a way that all assertions in the program can be proved automatically via the weakest-precondition calculus.

              I will show you a program that has been partially annotated with loop invariants. However, Why3 did not manage to prove all suggested assertions and invariants. It is likely that another invariant is needed to finish the proof and your job is to find it.

              To do so, you must proceed as follows, using the feedback from Why3:

              1. Summarize and **simplify** the first failing proof obligation.
              2. Suggest the **simplest** possible missing assumption that would make it true and which is also a plausible candidate for a loop invariant. Do not propose an invariant that is equivalent to one that was proposed already. Also, you **must** restrict yourself to **linear invariants**, which do not involve multiplication.

              Your answer must end with a code block that features a single formula, which is your proposed invariant.

              Why3 failed to prove that `x + 1 <> y` assuming `x <> y`, `x < 10` and `z - 1 >= 0`. Assumption `z - 1 >= 0` does not appear to ever hold in the program since `z` starts at 0 and is then only decremented. Thus, we propose its negation as an invariant, which is `z - 1 < 0` and which simplifies to `z < 1`.

              Proposed invariant:
