I'll show you a program where a comment indicates for each assertion or invariant whether it can be proved from the other annotations already or whether it is still unproved (or possibly false). I'll also show you a proposal for a new invariant. You must assign a score from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) to this proposal. A good proposal must respect the two following properties.

1. The proposed invariant is true (although not necessarily provable right away without adding other annotations).
2. Proving this invariant is useful for establishing the final assertion or proving that a currently unproven invariant is inductive.

Please terminate your answer with a triple-quote code block that contains a single integer number from 1 to 5.
