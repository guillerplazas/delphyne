"""
References to nodes, values, spaces and space elements.

References are serializable, immutable values that can be used to
identify nodes, spaces and values in a tree (possibly deeply nested).
References are useful for tooling and for representing serializable
traces (`Trace`). Also, references are attached to success nodes and
query answers (`Tracked`) so as to allow caching and enforce the
*locality invariant* (see `Tree`).

*Local* references identify a node, space or space element *relative* to
a given tree node. *Global* references are expressed relative to a
single, global origin.

In addition, three kinds of references can be distinguished:

- **Full references**: the default kind of references produced by
      `reify`. Query answers are stored as strings and elements of
      spaces induced by strategies are denoted by sequences of value
      references.
- **Id-based references**: shorter references, where query answers and
      success values are identified by unique identifiers. This concise
      format is used for exporting traces (see `Trace`).
- **Hint-based references**: query answers and success values are
      identified by sequences of *hints*. This format is used in the
      demonstration language (e.g. argument of test instruction `go
      compare(['', 'foo bar'])`) and when visualizing traces resulting
      from demonstrations.
