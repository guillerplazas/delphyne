## Debugging an Oracular Program {#debugging}

<!-- To debug the language server or even specific strategies, it is useful to attach a debugger to the language server. To do so, you should open VSCode at the root of the Delphyne repository and use the `Debug Server` debugging profile. This will start the server in debug mode (on port 8000). Starting the Delphyne extension when a server instance is running already will cause the extension to use this instance (as confirmed by the log output in the `Delphyne` channel). You can then put arbitrary breakpoints in the server source code or even in strategy code. -->
